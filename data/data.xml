	<title>Woman Killed in Capitol Embraced Trump and QAnon</title>
	<author>Dave Philipps</author>
	<body>Ashli Babbitt had been preparing for this day, the day when world events would turn her way. When a discouraged friend on Twitter asked last week, “When do we start winning?” Ms. Babbitt had an answer: “Jan 6, 2021.”Her name will now be connected to that date, and to shaky footage showing a crowd of rioters smashing glass on the door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby of the Capitol.At the front of that crowd is the small figure of Ms. Babbitt, wearing snow boots, jeans, and a Trump flag wrapped around her neck like a cape.“Go! Go!” she shouts, and then two men hoist her up to the rim of a broken window. As she sticks her head through the frame, a Capitol Police officer in plain clothes fires a shot, and she falls back into the crowd. Blood starts pouring from her mouth.A day after Ms. Babbitt’s death, as part of a mob storming the Capitol amid counting of Electoral College votes, a portrait of her is taking shape.Ms. Babbitt had left the Air Force after two wars and 14 years, settling near the working-class San Diego suburb where she was raised. Life after the military was not easy. After briefly working security at a nuclear power plant, she was struggling to keep a pool-supply company afloat.As a civilian, she found herself newly free to express her political views. Her social media feed was a torrent of messages celebrating President Trump; QAnon conspiracy theories; and tirades against immigration, drugs and Democratic leaders in California.“You guys refuse, refuse to choose America over your stupid political party, I am so tired of it,” she said in a video message posted on Twitter, addressing California politicians. “You can consider yourself put on notice. Me and the American people. I am so tired of it, I am woke, man, this is absolutely unbelievable.”The people close to Ms. Babbitt have all responded with shock. Her husband, Aaron Babbitt, 39, told a Fox affiliate in San Diego that he had sent his wife a message about 30 minutes before the shooting, and she never responded.Her brother, Roger Witthoeft, 32, said Ms. Babbitt had not told her family that she was planning to go to Washington. But he was not surprised that she would protest.“My sister was 35 and served 14 years — to me that’s the majority of your conscious adult life,” said Mr. Witthoeft, of Lakeside, Calif. “If you feel like you gave the majority of your life to your country and you’re not being listened to, that is a hard pill to swallow. That’s why she was upset.”Ms. Babbitt, who had four younger brothers, was raised in a mostly apolitical household, Mr. Witthoeft said. Their father worked in commercial flooring and their mother in a school program. Ms. Babbitt enlisted in the Air Force after finishing high school.While on active duty from 2004 to 2008, she met and married her first husband, Timothy McEntee. She worked as an enlisted security forces controller, a job whose duties include guarding gates at Air Force bases, and was deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq.She then served in the Air Force Reserves and the Air National Guard. In the Guard, she was assigned to a unit based near Washington that is known as the “Capital Guardians,” because one of their primary missions is defending the city. Security forces in the squadron regularly train with riot shields and clubs for what the Air Force calls “civil disturbance missions.” She was deployed twice more, to the United Arab Emirates in 2012 and 2014, according to an Air Force spokeswoman.Ms. Babbitt left the military as a relatively low-ranking senior airman in 2016, several years before she would have become eligible for a pension and other benefits.By then, she had found another source of income, working in security at Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Plant in Maryland. She was employed there from 2015 to 2017, according to a representative for Exelon, the energy company that runs the plant.It was there that she met Mr. Babbitt, who had been employed at the facility since 2007 and left in 2017, the representative said. The two moved back to her native California. She filed for divorce from Mr. McEntee in 2018.The transition was not entirely smooth. In 2016, Mr. Babbitt’s former girlfriend applied to a court for a protection order, telling the court that Ms. Babbitt, then known as Ashli McEntee, had approached her on a roadway and had rear-ended her car three times.“She was screaming at me and verbally threatening,” the complaint says. The court granted a protection order. The following year, the former girlfriend again applied for a protection order, which the court granted.Shortly after that, Ms. Babbitt relocated to California, where she helped purchase Fowlers Pool Service and Supply, a company where her brother, Mr. Witthoeft, said he had worked.Debating a criminal referral. The Jan. 6 House committee has grown divided over whether to make a criminal referral of former President Donald J. Trump to the Justice Department, even though it has concluded that it has enough evidence to do so. The debate centers on whether a referral would backfire by politically tainting the expanding federal investigation.Cooperating with investigators. Pat A. Cipollone and Patrick F. Philbi, two of Mr. Trump’s top White House lawyers, met with the Jan. 6 House committee, while Ali Alexander, a prominent organizer of pro-Trump events after the 2020 election, said he would assist in the federal investigation.Contempt charges. The House voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino Jr., two close allies of Mr. Trump, after the pair defied subpoenas from the special committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.“We all worked together as a family — my other little brother, me, her husband, me, my uncle,” Mr. Witthoeft said. “It was kind of nice, a family affair.”Ms. Babbitt appeared to struggle in business. In 2017 she took out a costly short-term business loan. In effect, it meant her pool business would have to pay an interest rate that she later calculated in court filings to be 169 percent.Within days of signing the loan agreement, she stopped making payments, only repaying about $3,400 of the $65,000 borrowed from the lender, EBF Partners, records show. The lender soon sued her.Ms. Babbitt’s politics were emphatically pro-Trump. On the door of the pool-supply company, a poster declares it to be a “mask free autonomous zone, better known as America,” where “we shake hands like men, fist bump like homies.”Leaving the military had freed her to participate in politics, something she savored, her brother said.“That was one of her things — for the first time in her life, she could actually say what she wanted to say, and didn’t have to bottle it up,” he said. She was frustrated, he said, with the number of homeless people in San Diego, and the difficulty of running a small business.“My sister was a normal Californian,” he said. “The issues she was mad about were the things all of us are mad about.”Her social media accounts suggest that she also, increasingly, embraced the conspiratorial thinking of QAnon, which has asserted that the 2020 presidential election was stolen by an elite Satan-worshiping cabal, and that it was up to ordinary people to reinstate Mr. Trump.She retweeted a post that promised a violent uprising that would lead to Mr. Trump’s second inauguration.“Nothing will stop us,” she wrote on Twitter the day before her death. “They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours …. dark to light!”Her brother said she was passionate about Mr. Trump’s cause, and believed she was standing up for the American people.“I know it mattered to her a lot at the end of her life,” he said. “It mattered so much that she died for it.”Candice Reed contributed reporting.

	<title>Wall Street Journal editorial board urges Trump to resign to avoid second impeachment.</title>
	<author>Michael M. Grynbaum</author>
	<body>The editorial board of The Wall Street Journal, the American flagship of Rupert Murdoch’s newspaper empire, denounced President Trump on Thursday for inciting a mob of his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol, declaring his behavior “impeachable” and encouraging Mr. Trump to resign his office to prevent a second impeachment by the Democratic-controlled House.In an unsigned article titled “Donald Trump’s Final Days,” the Journal’s editorial page — a bellwether for the conservative establishment — excoriated the president for “an assault on the constitutional process of transferring power after an election” and said “this week has probably finished him as a serious political figure.”“If Mr. Trump wants to avoid a second impeachment, his best path would be to take personal responsibility and resign,” the Journal wrote, concluding, “It is best for everyone, himself included, if he goes away quietly.”The Journal’s editorial page, led by the editor Paul Gigot, has criticized Mr. Trump in the past, sometimes harshly. But its latest salvo was a striking repudiation of the president by a news outlet controlled by Mr. Murdoch, whose Fox News cable network is home to several of Mr. Trump’s most loyal and longstanding media defenders.Mr. Murdoch’s publicists had previously indicated that he did not expect Mr. Trump to recapture the presidency, and another Murdoch publication, The New York Post, trumpeted President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory even as Mr. Trump refused to accept the results.The Post, in its own unsigned editorial on Thursday, stopped short of arguing that Mr. Trump should prematurely exit the White House, instead urging his aides “to stay and stop the crazy.” But given Mr. Murdoch’s influence on his publications’ political views, the Journal’s blunt words for Mr. Trump — who once craved Mr. Murdoch’s approval — signal that the mogul is now looking ahead to the start of the Biden presidency.</body>

	<title>Capitol Attack Leads Democrats to Demand That Trump Leave Office</title>
	<author>Maggie Haberman</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — President Trump’s administration plunged deeper into crisis on Thursday as more officials resigned in protest, prominent Republicans broke with him and Democratic congressional leaders threatened to impeach him for encouraging a mob that stormed the Capitol a day earlier.What was already shaping up as a volatile final stretch to the Trump presidency took on an air of national emergency as the White House emptied out and some Republicans joined Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a cascade of Democrats calling for Mr. Trump to be removed from office without waiting the 13 days until the inauguration of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.The prospect of actually short-circuiting Mr. Trump’s tenure in its last days appeared remote. Despite a rupture with Mr. Trump, Vice President Mike Pence privately ruled out invoking the disability clause of the 25th Amendment to sideline the president, as many had urged that he and the cabinet do, according to officials. Democrats suggested they could move quickly to impeachment, a step that would have its own logistical and political challenges.But the highly charged debate about Mr. Trump’s capacity to govern even for less than two weeks underscored the depth of anger and anxiety after the invasion of the Capitol that forced lawmakers to evacuate, halted the counting of the Electoral College votes for several hours and left people dead, including a Capitol Hill police officer who died Thursday night.Ending a day of public silence, Mr. Trump posted a 2½-minute video on Twitter on Thursday evening denouncing the mob attack in a way that he had refused to do a day earlier. Reading dutifully from a script prepared by his staff, he declared himself “outraged by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem” and told those who broke the law that “you will pay.”While he did not give up his false claims of election fraud, he finally conceded defeat. “A new administration will be inaugurated on Jan. 20,” Mr. Trump acknowledged. “My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power. This moment calls for healing and reconciliation.”Mr. Trump initially resisted taping the video, agreeing to do it only after aides pressed him and he appeared to suddenly realize he could face legal risk for prodding the mob, coming shortly after the chief federal prosecutor for Washington left open the possibility of investigating the president for illegally inciting the attack by telling supporters to march on the Capitol and show strength.Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, had warned Mr. Trump of just that danger on Wednesday as aides frantically tried to get the president to intervene and publicly call off rioters, which he did only belatedly, reluctantly and halfheartedly.“We are looking at all actors, not only the people who went into the building,” Michael R. Sherwin, the U.S. attorney in Washington, told reporters. Asked if that included Mr. Trump, he did not rule it out. “We’re looking at all actors,” he repeated. “If the evidence fits the elements of a crime, they’re going to be charged.”The president’s late, grudging video statement came after a day of disarray in the West Wing, where officials expressed growing alarm about the president’s erratic behavior and sought to keep more staff members from marching out the door. Aides hoped the latest statement would at least stanch the bleeding within Mr. Trump’s own party. Ivanka Trump, his eldest daughter, called lawmakers before it posted, promising it would reassure them.Despite the talk of healing, however, Mr. Trump quietly made plans to take a trip next week to the southwestern border to highlight his hard-line immigration policies, which have inflamed Washington over the years, according to a person briefed on the planning. He also told advisers he wanted to give a media exit interview, which they presumed might undercut any conciliatory notes. But the first family has discussed leaving the White House for good on Jan. 19, the day before the inauguration.Washington remained on edge on Thursday, awakening as if from a nightmare that turned out to be real and a changed political reality that caused many to reassess the future. As debris was swept up, businesses and storefronts remained boarded up, thousands of National Guard troops began fanning out around the city and some of the participants in the attack were arrested. Amid scrutiny over the security breakdown, the Capitol Police chief and the Senate sergeant-at-arms resigned.The main focus, however, was on Mr. Trump. Ms. Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, called on Mr. Pence and the cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment. But after the vice president refused to take their telephone calls, Ms. Pelosi told reporters that she would pursue impeachment if he did not act.“While it’s only 13 days left, any day can be a horror show for America,” Ms. Pelosi said, calling Mr. Trump’s actions on Wednesday a “seditious act.”“This president should not hold office one day longer,” said Mr. Schumer, who will become majority leader with the seating of two Democrats elected to the Senate in Georgia this week and the inauguration of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris as the tiebreaker.Mr. Biden would not address whether Mr. Trump should remain in office but called Wednesday “one of the darkest days in the history of our nation” and forcefully laid blame at the president’s feet after years of stirring the pot. “I wish we could say we couldn’t see it coming,” he said. “But that isn’t true. We could see it coming.”Even aides to Mr. Trump quietly discussed among themselves the possibility of invoking the 25th Amendment, and several prominent Republicans and Republican-leaning business groups endorsed the idea, including John F. Kelly, a former White House chief of staff to Mr. Trump; Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois; Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland; and Michael Chertoff, a former homeland security secretary under President George W. Bush.The conservative editorial page of The Wall Street Journal called on Mr. Trump to resign, terming his actions “impeachable.”But Mr. Pence, several cabinet secretaries and other administration officials concluded that the 25th Amendment was an unwieldy mechanism to remove a president, according to people informed about the discussions. The notion became even less plausible when two cabinet members — Elaine L. Chao, the transportation secretary, and Betsy DeVos, the education secretary — resigned in protest of the president’s encouragement of the mob.John R. Bolton, a former national security adviser to Mr. Trump who broke with him, said the idea was misguided. “People glibly have been saying it’s for situations like this,” he said in an interview. In fact, he said, the process of declaring a president unable to discharge his duties is drawn out and could lead to the chaos of having two people claiming to be president simultaneously.While an impeachment conviction would only strip Mr. Trump of his power days earlier than he is set to lose it anyway, it could also disqualify him from running again in 2024. And even if another impeachment might not be any more successful than the first one, in which he was acquitted by the Senate last year in the Ukraine pressure scheme, advocates argued that the mere threat of it could serve as a deterrent for the remaining days of his tenure.The latest danger signs may only encourage Mr. Trump to pardon himself before leaving office, an idea he had raised with aides even before the Capitol siege, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions.In several conversations since Election Day, Mr. Trump has told advisers that he is considering giving himself a pardon and, in other instances, asked whether he should and what the effect would be on him legally and politically, according to the two people.Mr. Trump has shown signs that his level of interest in pardoning himself goes beyond idle musings. He has long maintained he has the power to pardon himself, and his survey of aides’ views is typically a sign that he is preparing to follow through on his aims. He has also become increasingly convinced that his perceived enemies will use the levers of law enforcement to target him after he leaves office.Despite ransacking the Capitol, the mob failed to stop Congress from counting the Electoral College votes in the final procedural stage of the election held Nov. 3. After the rioters were cleared from the building, lawmakers voted down efforts by Mr. Trump’s Republican allies to block electors from swing states and formally sealed Mr. Biden’s victory at 3:41 a.m. Thursday with Mr. Pence presiding in his role as president of the Senate.Mr. Trump’s Twitter account was suspended for part of the day on Thursday before being restored, temporarily depriving him of that platform. But Facebook and Instagram barred him from their sites for the remainder of his presidency.Behind the scenes, Mr. Trump railed about Mr. Pence, who refused to use his position presiding over the electoral count to block it despite the president’s repeated demands.The vice president, who for four years had remained loyal to Mr. Trump to the point of obsequiousness, was angry in return at the president’s public lashing. Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, told The Tulsa World that Mr. Pence privately expressed a sense of betrayal by Mr. Trump “after all the things I’ve done for him.”Debating a criminal referral. The Jan. 6 House committee has grown divided over whether to make a criminal referral of former President Donald J. Trump to the Justice Department, even though it has concluded that it has enough evidence to do so. The debate centers on whether a referral would backfire by politically tainting the expanding federal investigation.Cooperating with investigators. Pat A. Cipollone and Patrick F. Philbi, two of Mr. Trump’s top White House lawyers, met with the Jan. 6 House committee, while Ali Alexander, a prominent organizer of pro-Trump events after the 2020 election, said he would assist in the federal investigation.Contempt charges. The House voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino Jr., two close allies of Mr. Trump, after the pair defied subpoenas from the special committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.Even when the vice president had to be evacuated during the siege on Wednesday, the president never checked with him personally to make sure he was OK. The Secret Service agents wanted the vice president to leave the building, but he refused and sheltered in the basement, according to two officials. Congressional leaders were whisked to Fort McNair for their safety, but the vice president later urged them to finish the count at the Capitol.On Thursday, Mr. Pence did not go to the White House complex, instead working out of the vice-presidential residence, according to administration officials.He was not the only one feeling betrayed by the president. In the White House, aides were exasperated and despondent, convinced that Mr. Trump had effectively nullified four years of work and ensured that his presidency would be defined in history by the image of him sending a mob to the Capitol in an assault on democracy.Ms. Chao stepped down a day after her husband, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, forcefully repudiated Mr. Trump’s effort to overturn the election. “Yesterday, our country experienced a traumatic and entirely avoidable event as supporters of the president stormed the Capitol building following a rally he addressed,” she wrote in her resignation letter. “As I’m sure is the case with many of you, it has deeply troubled me in a way that I simply cannot set aside.”In her own letter, Ms. DeVos laid the responsibility for the mayhem directly at Mr. Trump’s feet. “There is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation, and it is the inflection point for me,” she wrote, just a couple weeks after Mr. Trump pardoned four security contractors convicted of war crimes in Iraq committed while working for her brother, Erik Prince.In addition to three White House aides who resigned on Wednesday, others stepping down included Matthew Pottinger, the deputy national security adviser; Tyler Goodspeed, the acting chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers; and Mick Mulvaney, the former acting White House chief of staff, who has been serving as a special envoy to Northern Ireland.Also leaving were two other National Security Council aides as well as officials at the Justice and Commerce Departments. Gabriel Noronha, a Trump appointee who worked on Iran issues at the State Department, was fired after tweeting that the president was “entirely unfit to remain in office.”“The events of yesterday made my position no longer tenable,” Mr. Goodspeed said in a brief interview. On CNBC, Mr. Mulvaney said, “I can’t stay here, not after yesterday.”Mr. Mulvaney went further, suggesting Mr. Trump had become increasingly unhinged in recent months. “Clearly he is not the same as he was eight months ago and certainly the people advising him are not the same as they were eight months ago and that leads to a dangerous sort of combination, as you saw yesterday,” he said.Former Attorney General William P. Barr, perhaps the president’s most important defender until stepping down last month after a falling out, denounced Mr. Trump. In a statement to The Associated Press, Mr. Barr said that the president’s actions were a “betrayal of his office and supporters” and that “orchestrating a mob to pressure Congress is inexcusable.”Even one of Mr. Trump’s lawyers in his bid to reverse the election results in Pennsylvania, Jerome M. Marcus, broke with him on Thursday, filing a motion withdrawing because “the client has used the lawyer’s services to perpetrate a crime and the client insists upon taking action that the lawyer considers repugnant and with which the lawyer has a fundamental disagreement.”But concern about the exodus grew among some officials, who feared what Mr. Trump could do without anyone around him and worried about destabilizing the United States in a dangerous world. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo; Robert C. O’Brien, the national security adviser; and John Ratcliffe, the director of national intelligence, among others, were urged to stay. Mr. Cipollone received calls from senators and cabinet members urging him to remain.“I understand the high emotions here,” former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said in an interview, “but I hope that the national security team will stay in place because it’s important to send a signal to our adversaries that the United States is prepared and functioning and they shouldn’t try to take advantage at this time.”In the weeks since the election, Mr. Trump has shrunk his circle, shutting out those who told him to concede and favoring those telling him what he wanted to hear, that he was somehow cheated of the presidency. As supporters stormed into the Capitol on Wednesday, Mr. Trump was initially pleased, officials said, and disregarded aides pleading with him to intercede.Unable to get through to him, Mark Meadows, his chief of staff, sought help from Ivanka Trump. Former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a longtime friend who has publicly criticized his efforts to invalidate the election results, tried to call Mr. Trump during the violence, but could not get through to him.The video that Mr. Trump eventually released on Wednesday justified the anger of the rioters even as he told them it was time to go home. Rather than condemn their action, he embraced them. “We love you,” he said. “You’re very special.”Mr. Christie said he believed that Mr. Trump deliberately encouraged the crowd to march on the Capitol as a way to put pressure on Mr. Pence to reject the election results during the congressional count.“Unfortunately, I think what the president showed yesterday is he believes he’s more important than the system, bigger than the office,” Mr. Christie told the radio show host Brian Kilmeade. “And I think he’s going to learn that that was a very, very big miscalculation.”Peter Baker reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.</body>

	<title>Muslim Cleric Tied to Bali Nightclub Bombing Is Freed From Prison</title>
	<author>Muktita Suhartono</author>
	<body>BANGKOK — One of Indonesia’s most notorious terrorists, the Muslim cleric Abu Bakar Bashir, was released from prison on Friday after serving more than 10 years of a 15-year sentence for helping establish a terrorist training camp.Mr. Bashir, 82, is the co-founder and former spiritual leader of a clandestine terrorist group, Jemaah Islamiyah, that carried out a series of deadly attacks in the 2000s, including the Bali nightclub bombing in 2002 that killed 202 people, many of them Australian tourists.Prison authorities said that he had completed his sentence with a reduction of 55 months for good behavior, Islamic holidays and other reductions. His release was confirmed by his lawyer, Achmad Midan.In Australia, relatives and friends of the Bali bombing victims expressed disappointment over Mr. Bashir’s release. Australia’s foreign minister, Marise Payne, urged Indonesia to monitor his activities closely.“Our embassy in Jakarta has made clear our concerns that such individuals be prevented from further inciting others to carry out future attacks against innocent civilians,” Ms. Payne said this week. Mr. Bashir’s release comes as the government is trying to combat  another radical Islamic group, the Islamic Defenders Front, whose fiery leader, Rizieq Shihab, has called for a “moral revolution.” The authorities arrested Mr. Rizieq last month on charges of violating coronavirus protocols, and they ordered his organization to disband.The country’s antiterrorism police also arrested 23 members of Jemaah Islamiyah last month, including Aris Sumarsono, better known as Zulkarnaen, a leader who had been wanted for 18 years.Despite Mr. Bashir’s long history of terrorist activities, experts said they do not believe he poses a threat, given his age and isolation from the extremist movement while in prison.“I don’t think his release changes anything in Indonesia,” said Sidney Jones, director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict in Jakarta who has long followed his activities. “Today’s terrorists can find all they need in terms of inspiration and instruction on their smartphones. They may respect him, but the world has moved on.”Mr. Bashir, whose white hair and grin give him a kindly, grandfatherly appearance, had long sought to establish a caliphate, or Islamic state, in Southeast Asia by any means necessary.In 1972, he co-founded an Islamic school in central Java, which served as a recruiting ground for Jemaah Islamiyah.A crackdown on Islamists by the dictator Suharto forced him to flee to Malaysia, where he lived for many years and helped build the group into a formidable international network with cells in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines.Among his close associates was his fellow Indonesian cleric, Riduan Isamuddin, also known as Hambali, who was believed to be Al Qaeda’s main link to Jemaah Islamiyah and the mastermind of numerous bombings. He has been imprisoned at the Guantánamo Bay prison for 14 years.After Suharto’s fall in 1998, the two clerics returned to Indonesia from Malaysia, and Jemaah Islamiyah began its regional campaign of violence, including bombings of churches, the Bali nightclub and the JW Marriott Hotel in Jakarta.The United States accused Mr. Bashir of being a key operative for Al Qaeda, but the Indonesian authorities had trouble making charges stick. He was acquitted of seven terrorism charges for the Bali bombing, but served 26 months on conspiracy and immigration charges.Mr. Bashir praised the Bali bombers as “Islamic heroes” but denied any responsibility. Mr. Bashir was arrested again in 2010 for helping mobilize and finance a militant group that set up an armed training camp in Aceh province. At the time of his trial, his lawyer asserted that the cleric faced charges only because of pressure from Washington. His release comes 10 years and five months after his arrest.Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, while seeking a second term in 2019, was on the verge of granting Mr. Bashir early release as a concession to conservative Muslims. But he withdrew that plan in the face of strong opposition at home and in Australia.Mr. Bashir “is a household name, but he is not influential anymore,” said Alto Labetubun, an Indonesian terrorism analyst. “There’s always a possibility for him to be the patron of a violence cycle or new terror acts. But I believe his era has ended.”Mr. Bashir’s family members said they did not plan a large celebration to welcome him home, perhaps having learned a lesson from Mr. Rizieq, who was arrested after organizing gatherings of thousands of supporters in defiance of coronavirus protocols upon his return from self-imposed exile in Saudi Arabia.</body>

	<title>More states are detecting the highly contagious virus variant.</title>
	<author>Remy Tumin</author>
	<body>The list of states to identify the dangerous new coronavirus variant is growing.Texas, Connecticut and Pennsylvania confirmed their first cases on Thursday, joining California, Colorado, Georgia, Florida and New York.Florida has at least 22 confirmed cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. California has reported at least 26.Experts have warned that the United States is woefully ill-equipped to track the rapidly transmissible variant. Without a robust, national system to identify genetic variations of the coronavirus, states are left on their own to identify the variant.The Texas Department of Health and Human Services said an adult male resident of Harris County, which includes Houston, with no history of travel tested positive for the coronavirus. Genetic sequencing this week showed that the infection was caused by the variant.“The fact that this person had no travel history suggests this variant is already circulating in Texas,” Dr. John Hellerstedt, the commissioner of state health services, said in a statement. “It’s not surprising that it showed up here given how rapidly it spreads.”Dr. Hellerstedt urged Texans to “redouble our commitment&quot; to social distancing and public health measures.In Connecticut, Gov. Ned Lamont said two individuals between 15 and 25 years old had tested positive for the variant. Both had traveled outside of the state, he said, one to Ireland and the other to New York. Genetic sequencing showed the cases are unrelated.Pennsylvania also reported that its case was because of international exposure.Last month, Britain became the first country to identify the new variant, which is now surging there and burdening its hospitals with new cases. Now, the variant has been identified in at least 33 countries, including Britain. Dr. Hans Kluge, the World Health Organization’s regional director for Europe, called the spread of the variant across the continent “an alarming situation.”“Without increased control to slow its spread, there will be an increased impact on already stressed and pressurized health facilities,” Dr. Kluge said at a briefing on Thursday, warning that the variant may, over time, “replace other circulating lineages” as it has in Britain.Dr. Kluge urged countries to continue to investigate transmission, increase genetic sequencing and to share data.</body>

	<title>Did the Capitol Attack Break the President’s Spell?</title>
	<author>Michelle Goldberg</author>
	<body>It was probably always going to come to this. Donald Trump has been telling us for years that he would not accept an electoral defeat. He has cheered violence and threatened insurrection. On Tuesday he tweeted that Democrats and Republicans who weren’t cooperating in his coup attempt should look “at the thousands of people pouring into D.C. They won’t stand for a landslide election victory to be stolen.” He urged his supporters to mass on the Capitol, tweeting, “Be there, will be wild!” They took him seriously and literally.The day after Georgia elected its first Black senator — the pastor, no less, of Martin Luther King Jr.’s  church — and its first Jewish senator, an insurgent marched through the halls of Congress with a Confederate banner. Someone set up a noose outside. Someone brought zip-tie handcuffs. Lest there be any doubt about their intentions, a few of the marauders wore T-shirts that said “MAGA Civil War, Jan. 6, 2021.”If you saw Wednesday’s scenes in any other country — vandals scaling walls and breaking windows, parading around the legislature with enemy flags and making themselves at home in quickly abandoned governmental offices — it would be obvious enough that some sort of putsch was underway.Yet we won’t know for some time what the attack on the Capitol means for this country. Either it marked the beginning of the end of Trumpism, or another stage in the unraveling of American liberal democracy.There is at least some cause for a curdled sort of optimism. More than any other episode of Trump’s political career — more than the “Access Hollywood” tape or Charlottesville — the day’s desecration and mayhem threw the president’s malignancy into high relief. For years, many of us have waited for the “Have you no sense of decency?” moment when Trump’s demagogic powers would deflate like those of Senator Joseph McCarthy before him. The storming of Congress by a human 8chan thread in thrall to Trump’s delusions may have been it.Since it happened, there have been once-unthinkable repudiations of the president. The National Association of Manufacturers, a major business group, called on Vice President Mike Pence to consider invoking the 25th Amendment. Trump’s former attorney general Bill Barr, who’d been one of Trump’s most craven defenders, accused the president of betraying his office by “orchestrating a mob.”Several administration officials resigned, including Trump’s former chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who’d been serving as special envoy to Northern Ireland. In an interview with CNBC, Mulvaney was astonishingly self-pitying, complaining that people who “spent time away from our families, put our careers on the line to go work for Donald Trump,” will now forever be remembered for serving “the guy who tried to overtake the government.”Mulvaney’s insistence that the president is “not the same as he was eight months ago” is transparent nonsense. But his weaselly effort to distance himself is still heartening, a sign that some Republicans suddenly realize that association with Trump has stained them. When the rats start jumping, you know the ship is sinking.So Trump’s authority is ebbing before our eyes. Having helped deliver the Senate to Democrats, he’s no longer much use to Republicans like Mitch McConnell. With two weeks left in the president’s term, social media has invoked its own version of the 25th Amendment. Twitter, after years of having let Trump spread conspiracy theories and incite brutality on its platform, suddenly had enough: It deleted three of his tweets, locked his account and threatened “permanent suspension.” Facebook and Instagram blocked the president for at least the remainder of his term. He may still be able to launch a nuclear strike in the next two weeks, but he can’t post.Yet the forces Trump has unleashed can’t simply be stuffed back in the bottle. Most of the Republican House caucus still voted to challenge the legitimacy of Joe Biden’s election. And the MAGA movement’s terrorist fringe may be emboldened by Wednesday’s incursion into the heart of American government.“The extremist violent faction views today as a huge win,” Elizabeth Neumann, a former Trump counterterrorism official who has accused the president of encouraging white nationalists, told me on Wednesday. She pointed out that “The Turner Diaries,” the seminal white nationalist novel, features a mortar attack on the Capitol. “This is like a right-wing extremist fantasy that has been fulfilled,” she said.Neumann believes that if Trump immediately left office — either via impeachment, the 25th Amendment or resignation — it would temporarily inflame right-wing extremists, but ultimately marginalize them. “Having such a unified, bipartisan approach, that he is dangerous, that he has to be removed,” would, she said, send “such a strong message to the country that I hope that it wakes up a number of people of good will that have just been deceived.”In a Twitter thread on Thursday, Kathleen Belew, a scholar of the white power movement, wrote about how, in “The Turner Diaries,” the point of the assault on Congress wasn’t causing mass casualties. It was “showing people that even the Capitol can be attacked.”Trump’s mob has now demonstrated to the world that the institutions of American democracy are softer targets than most of us imagined. What happens to Trump next will tell us all whether this ailing country still has the will to protect them.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

	<title>Racial Double Standard of Capitol Police Draws Outcry</title>
	<author>John Eligon</author>
	<body>While protesting the police killing of a Black teenager in Ferguson, Mo., several years ago, Johnetta Elzie said she was manhandled by officers. She said they pointed rifles at Black women who were pushing toddlers in strollers and cursed at them to turn around.Similar scenes unfolded all summer, as police officers clashed with scores of Black Lives Matter protesters. Many times, officers used batons and chemical agents to disperse crowds.And so what Ms. Elzie saw on television Wednesday afternoon infuriated her: A mob of mostly white Trump supporters stormed past police officers and vandalized the United States Capitol while officers, after initially offering resistance, mostly stood by. Some officers parted barricades, others held doors open and one was seen on video escorting a woman down steps.“What a joke,” Ms. Elzie said. “I mean, they didn’t even pinch the white people. It wasn’t even like a family dispute. In a family dispute, you might at least hit your sister or something like that. This wasn’t even that. It was almost like tear gas was not readily available.”Black Lives Matter activists across the country expressed outrage on Thursday at what they said was a tepid response from law enforcement officers to mostly white protesters, saying it stood in stark contrast to the aggressive tactics they have endured for years — officers in full riot gear who have used tear-gas, rubber bullets and batons. It also underscored the country’s uneven system of justice, many said, and lent credence to their insistence that Black people are devalued and viewed as inherently dangerous.In a national address Thursday afternoon, President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. acknowledged the seemingly disparate treatment, saying he had received a text message from his granddaughter who questioned the police response at the Capitol.“She said, ‘Pop, this isn’t fair. No one can tell me that if it had been a group of Black Lives Matter protesting yesterday, they wouldn’t have been treated very, very differently than the mob of thugs that stormed the Capitol,’” he said, adding, “We all know that’s true. And it is unacceptable. Totally unacceptable.”Officials with the Capitol Police, a federal law enforcement agency responsible for securing the Capitol building, have defended Thursday’s response, saying the officers were under prepared and overwhelmed by the pro-Trump mob.Joel Shults, a former police chief of Adams State University in Colorado, said “the right balance of quelling a disturbance versus allowing the disorder to continue” was a difficult calculation for law enforcement to make. Every case presents its unique challenges, he said, adding that a lack of information and the location of Wednesday’s riot might have influenced the police’s response — and not the race of the largely white crowd that stormed the building.“To have a lot of citizen-police violence on the steps of the Capitol,” he said, “I think it was really important that that not happen.”Black activists noted that when they have planned protests, the police have rarely seemed ill prepared. This week, for instance, National Guard troops descended on Kenosha, Wis., and metal barricades were erected around that city’s courthouse the day before a prosecutor announced that no charges would be filed against an officer who shot a man, Jacob Blake, multiple times in the back last summer.Last summer, a peaceful violin vigil in Aurora, Colo., to memorialize a Black man who died during a police arrest was disrupted when officers in riot gear charged the park and dispersed pepper spray, sending families with children fleeing. The police argued that there was a small group of agitators among the crowd, a contention disputed by many in attendance, who had been sitting on the lawn listening to people play the violin when the police descended.And the day after the presidential election in November, hundreds of activists marched through the streets of Minneapolis, advocating for an end to police brutality. The group, which was spirited but peaceful and included parents with children, eventually marched onto an interstate. The plan was to walk to the next exit, something that should have only taken about 15 minutes, said Sam Martinez, one of the organizers.Instead, the State Police surrounded the group while on the highway and demanded that everyone sit down to be arrested. Local elected officials frantically tried to negotiate with the authorities to let the demonstrators leave the highway, to no avail.The police, saying that the demonstrators violated the law and endangered public safety by entering the highway, either arrested or cited and released nearly 650 protesters. The process took about five hours. Most were given misdemeanor charges, but a 19-year-old woman received felony riot charges for shining a laser pointer into the eyes of a police officer.“It’s a glaring example of how unjust this system really is,” said Mx. Martinez, noting the disparity between the hundreds of arrests on the highway versus the handful of arrests at the Capitol. “If that had been us, there would have been way more than one casualty.”Debating a criminal referral. The Jan. 6 House committee has grown divided over whether to make a criminal referral of former President Donald J. Trump to the Justice Department, even though it has concluded that it has enough evidence to do so. The debate centers on whether a referral would backfire by politically tainting the expanding federal investigation.Cooperating with investigators. Pat A. Cipollone and Patrick F. Philbi, two of Mr. Trump’s top White House lawyers, met with the Jan. 6 House committee, while Ali Alexander, a prominent organizer of pro-Trump events after the 2020 election, said he would assist in the federal investigation.Contempt charges. The House voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino Jr., two close allies of Mr. Trump, after the pair defied subpoenas from the special committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.The highway protest in Minneapolis came months after city police officers killed George Floyd, sparking widespread protests and calls for an end to systemic racism. Amid chaotic demonstrations in the days following the killing, the police retreated from a police precinct headquarters, allowing protesters to descend on it and burn it down.But even that was not comparable to what unfolded at the Capitol on Wednesday, said Jeremiah Ellison, a Minneapolis City Councilman. In the days preceding the burning of the precinct, the police had been firing rubber bullets and tear-gas at protesters in what Mr. Ellison said he believed was an overreaction at times.The police at the Capitol did not show that same hostility toward the demonstrators there, he said.“I think the police will view a leftist protester with a gas mask as more dangerous than a right-wing protester with a semiautomatic rifle,” Mr. Ellison said.Activists who protest the police say they believe they are targeted because of their criticism of law enforcement.In a federal lawsuit against the city of St. Louis, a judge wrote in a 2017 ruling on a preliminary injunction that the plaintiffs were likely to prevail on their claim that the Police Department “has a custom or policy of using chemical agents without warning on citizens” criticizing the police.The lawsuit centers on the arrest of more than 120 people in 2017 during a protest of the acquittal of a white officer who killed a Black man in St. Louis. Earlier that evening, some protesters had broken windows and knocked over large flower pots downtown. The police declared an unlawful assembly and ordered people to leave.Hours later, there were still dozens of people peacefully milling about a downtown street corner that was a few blocks from where the police had told the crowd to leave. Officers eventually moved in and arrested everyone who was still out — sweeping up members of the Air Force who happened to be in the area and at least one journalist in the process.Video of the mass arrest showed one officer firing pepper spray at the people being arrested, “who all appear to be on the ground and complying with police commands,” Judge Catherine D. Perry of Federal District Court wrote in her injunction.Javad Khazaeli, a lawyer representing several of the plaintiffs, said that even though his clients were peaceful, “The police made the choice to use violence.”But the Capitol Police on Wednesday “made the choice” not to, he said. “It couldn’t be a more perfect example for everybody to see the two different criminal justice systems we have in America.”</body>

	<title>Republicans Splinter Over Whether to Make a Full Break From Trump</title>
	<author>Alexander Burns</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — President Trump not only inspired a mob to storm the Capitol on Wednesday — he also brought the Republican Party close to a breaking point.Having lost the presidency, the House and now the Senate on Mr. Trump’s watch, Republicans are so deeply divided that many are insisting that they must fully break from the president to rebound.Those divisions were in especially sharp relief this week when scores of House Republicans sided with Mr. Trump in voting to block certification of the election — in a tally taken after the mob rampaged through the Capitol — while dozens of other House members and all but eight Republican senators refused to go along.Republicans who spent years putting off a reckoning with Mr. Trump over his dangerous behavior are now confronting a disturbing prospect: that Wednesday’s episode of violence, incited by Mr. Trump’s remarks, could linger for decades as a stain on the party — much as the Watergate break-in and the Great Depression shadowed earlier generations of Republicans.“His conduct over the last eight weeks has been injurious to the country and incredibly harmful to the party,” said Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey who was the first major Republican to endorse Mr. Trump.Mr. Christie said Republicans must “separate message from messenger,” because “I don’t think the messenger can recover from yesterday.”A small number of Republican officials who have been critical of Mr. Trump in the past, including Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and two governors, Phil Scott of Vermont and Larry Hogan of Maryland, called for Mr. Trump’s removal from office.Top Republicans ran headlong into an immediate problem, though: Millions of Republican voters are seeking no such separation from Mr. Trump, nor are the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, many of his House colleagues and state lawmakers around the country.For the moment at least, they are far more loyal to their lame-duck president than the traditional party leaders who preceded him.Still, spurred by the threat many of them felt to their physical safety, and reduced to a political minority following twin losses in Georgia’s Senate runoffs, a swelling group of Republican lawmakers and strategists said publicly what many in their ranks have long voiced privately: It is time to move on.“What happened in Georgia, what happened today are all indicative that we have to chart a course,” said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the second-ranking Republican, who Mr. Trump has demanded be unseated in a primary next year. “I think our identity for the past several years was built around an individual, we got to get back to where it’s built on a set of principles and ideas and policies.”Mr. Thune added that “those conversations” must “happen pretty soon.”A handful of other Republican officials, including some who are also up for re-election next year, were even more critical.Asked if Republicans should cut ties with Mr. Trump, Representative Fred Upton of Michigan, a 34-year lawmaker, said, “After today I do.”Standing after midnight in a Capitol Rotunda still littered with the dirt and detritus left behind by the mob that breached the building, Mr. Upton said: “This is his legacy, not the tax cuts, not the judges. Today.”Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who Mr. Trump has also demanded be unseated, offered a measure of deadpan when she said Republicans should part ways with their divisive leader. “I think today is a pretty good reason why,” Ms. Murkowski said walking into a Senate chamber surrounded by machine gun-bearing law enforcement officers.The Republican crackup has been years in the making, but the party will hardly make a clean break — if it makes one at all.The gulf between Republican leaders and their grass-roots activists has never been wider since the start of the Trump era. And, as when the divisions first emerged after Mr. Trump denigrated Mexicans, Muslims and women, the party is not feuding over any sort of grand policy agenda. It’s simply a personal loyalty test.While veteran lawmakers were flatly urging a separation, more than 100 House Republicans, unpersuaded by the chaos in the Capitol, continued with their effort to block Congress from certifying President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory. Some adopted conspiracy theories from right-wing news outlets and social media that it was left-wing saboteurs carrying out a false flag operation who ravaged the halls of Congress.By Thursday morning, Mr. Trump was greeted with applause when he dialed into a breakfast at the winter meeting of the Republican National Committee, most of whose members have become a reflection of the party’s pro-Trump activist wing. On Friday, the committee was set to re-elect Mr. Trump’s handpicked committee chair with no opposition.When it comes to Mr. Trump, few better grasp the difficulty of balancing principle and political survival than Representative Chip Roy of Texas. A former chief of staff to Senator Ted Cruz, Mr. Roy broke with his former boss and was a leader in a group of House conservatives who resisted the president’s push to reject certification of Mr. Biden’s victory.“We are divided about even ‘life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,’’’ Mr. Roy said in an impassioned speech on the House floor Wednesday night. He said those words once united the nation but now they “tear us apart because we disagree about what they even mean.’’Now Mr. Roy is facing opprobrium from many Trumpists and wrestling with how the party can harness Trump-inspired grass-roots energy without remaining a cult of personality.“If the Republican Party is centered solely on President Trump himself, we will fail,” he said. “But if we forget what it was about his message that appealed to people who are really frustrated, then we will also fail.”Republicans may recover next year the way minority parties usually do in a new president’s first midterm election — with an oppositional message against Democrats. But their longer-term challenges could prove harder to resolve. The party drifted from any unifying policy vision in the Trump years and memorably did not even create a party platform last year.Debating a criminal referral. The Jan. 6 House committee has grown divided over whether to make a criminal referral of former President Donald J. Trump to the Justice Department, even though it has concluded that it has enough evidence to do so. The debate centers on whether a referral would backfire by politically tainting the expanding federal investigation.Cooperating with investigators. Pat A. Cipollone and Patrick F. Philbi, two of Mr. Trump’s top White House lawyers, met with the Jan. 6 House committee, while Ali Alexander, a prominent organizer of pro-Trump events after the 2020 election, said he would assist in the federal investigation.Contempt charges. The House voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino Jr., two close allies of Mr. Trump, after the pair defied subpoenas from the special committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.Former Gov. Jon M. Huntsman Jr. of Utah, a Republican who served as Mr. Trump’s envoy to Russia, said the G.O.P. lacked a coherent set of priorities needed to make it a “relevant governing party.”“The party has to admit its failures and it has to bring party leadership from all demographics together in pursuit of a common agenda,” Mr. Huntsman said, adding, “We’ve got to basically start from a blank slate.”Some Republicans, particularly those who were always critical of Mr. Trump, are adamant that his exile will reveal him to be more of a spent force than a power broker. The president’s political legacy, they say, is one of defeat and division.“These antics have dampened enthusiasm for him and will diminish his influence even more,” said former Senator Jeff Flake, long an opponent of Mr. Trump.For a number of Republicans who have long been skeptical of Mr. Trump, the events of the last two months have been clarifying. From his initial refusal to concede defeat and his relentless attacks on Republican state officials, which undermined the party’s hopes for winning the Georgia Senate seats, to savaging lawmakers and his own vice president just hours before the Capitol riot, Mr. Trump has proved himself a political arsonist.“Trump is a political David Koresh,” said Billy Piper, a former chief of staff to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, referring to the cult leader who died with his followers during an F.B.I. siege in Waco, Texas. “He sees the end coming and wants to burn it all down and take as many with him as possible.”The violence in Washington appeared to embolden an array of Republican lawmakers, including some who took office only days ago, to condemn Mr. Trump’s political recklessness and urge the party toward a different course. The party’s humiliating double losses in Georgia, the day after Mr. Trump appeared at a rally there, also served to punctuate the growing peril for Republicans in the fastest-growing, more culturally diverse parts of the country, which are on track to amass more political power in the coming decade.The party faces a threat to its financial base, too. Several of the most powerful business federations in Washington denounced the chaos this week in stinging language, including an extraordinary statement from the normally nonpolitical National Association of Manufacturers that suggested Mr. Pence invoke the 25th Amendment to remove the president from office. Representative Tom Reed of New York, who has emerged as a leader of more moderate Republicans in the House, said Thursday that the party needed to begin “not worrying about base politics as much, and standing up to that base.” He argued that Republicans should pursue compromise legislation with Mr. Biden on issues like climate change, and forecast that a sizable number of Republicans would take that path.“If that means standing up to the base in order to achieve something, they’ll do it,” Mr. Reed predicted.Mr. Reed warned his party that the Democrats would depict the G.O.P. as a dangerous party in 2022 if they did not rebut that charge.“They’re going to, obviously, paint us with the backdrop of yesterday,” he said, alluding to the mob violence.Representative Young Kim, a Republican elected two months ago to a purple seat in Southern California, said she had been “disgusted” by the Wednesday assault on the Capitol and blamed Mr. Trump for dishonestly telling his supporters that they had a chance to overturn the election.“The leaders at the top — in this case, our president — should have taken some responsibility and put down the flame before it ignited to the level that it did,” Ms. Kim said, adding of the mob: “People came because they listened to our leader, the president, telling us: Come to Washington, you have a vote, you have a voice, you can change the outcome. Well, that was simply not true.”Ms. Kim, who is one of a cohort of Republican female and minority candidates who helped the party cut deeply into the Democratic majority in the last election, acknowledged that she would most likely face “some blowback from the base” for voting to certify Mr. Biden’s election. But she said that should not be a primary consideration as Republicans emerge from the Trump era.“We need to be able to stand up and use our own independent judgment,” she said.</body>

	<title>We Needed More Significant Others</title>
	<author>Logan Ury</author>
	<body>Last June, instead of a rehearsal dinner the night before our wedding, Scott and I hosted a rooftop comedy roast for his soon-to-be-amputated right foot. One by one, our friends took turns walking up to the mic, wiping it down and removing their masks before making jokes about my fiancé’s doomed appendage.“At least for the rest of your life,” said our friend Tank, “everything you do will be considered ‘brave.’”A few months earlier, as coronavirus cases started to rise and people began hoarding toilet paper, Scott had ankle pain that wouldn’t go away. When physical therapy didn’t help, he got an M.R.I. Inconclusive results led to a PET scan.After his first visit with the orthopedic oncologist, Scott stood in our newly outfitted home office in our small San Francisco apartment and said, “She told me if it’s a bone tumor, I’ll need surgery.”“We can handle that,” I said. “Plenty of people have ankle surgery, right?”“Surgery,” he said, “means amputation.”After multiple biopsies over many weeks (Scott said he felt as if he were an Ikea desk being drilled into), his doctor called to deliver the diagnosis. We pulled off the highway and put her on speakerphone. It was osteosarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer that afflicts some 800 Americans a year. It appeared to have spread. The five-year survival rate for multifocal osteosarcoma is 30 percent.[Sign up for Love Letter, our weekly email about Modern Love, weddings and relationships.]After we hung up, Scott — vegan, athlete, artificial intelligence engineer, the kind of person who adds turmeric to all his food — took my hand. Together for five years, we were only 32.“Don’t worry,” he said. “I’ve never been below the top 30 percent for anything. But if something happens to me, I want to make sure you’re taken care of. Let’s get married now.”We scheduled Scott’s below-the-knee amputation for 10 days later, a Monday. Our friends announced they were throwing us a wedding in Golden Gate Park the day before the surgery.I wanted a wedding celebration, even if it was last-minute, so we could mark the occasion with more than just the administrative staff of the county clerk. Scott, however, wanted something more in line with his arid sense of humor: a foot roast. That’s how we ended up gathered on a roof telling amputation jokes and making bad puns about Scott getting “cold feet” before the wedding.The next day we stood, masked and socially distanced, in Golden Gate Park with our closest friends, gathered at a week’s notice. I looked at Scott, handsome in his navy suit, noting that this was the last day he would fill it out with two legs and two feet.Twenty-four hours later, I met him in the postoperative recovery room. He grinned a goofy, Fentanyl-fueled smile, but it faded as the drugs wore off and what he called the “Civil War pain” of his surgery kicked in. Soon the hospital’s Covid-19 visitor restrictions forced me to leave, and I stole one last glance at the space in the bed where the bottom of his leg had been.When I unpacked Scott’s suitcase at home, I discovered his right shoe rolled up in a trash bag. Upset about that and all of the right shoes he would no longer need, I collected every one and shoved them into the back of the closet.After our honeymoon (spent on the seventh floor of the hospital, followed by my mother-in-law moving into the apartment next door for two weeks), we received more bad news: The other suspicious spots meant he would have to undergo six cycles of intensive chemotherapy, during which he would need to live in the hospital. Two major surgeries would also be required to remove the lesions.We faced the hardest year of our lives. Covid precautions would make it hard for friends or family to help or even visit, and the hospital would only allow Scott a single visitor per day. I looked into the future and saw night after night of coming home to an empty apartment, numbing myself with pizza and Netflix, and thought: We can’t do this by ourselves.We tried to soldier on but struggled. One afternoon, our good friends Kristen and Phil visited us in our backyard; for the first time, they understood the gravity of what we were dealing with.Not long after, they invited us to their place in Oakland for an outdoor dinner, but “their place” requires some explanation. A couple of years earlier, they founded a co-owned community called Radish, where a dozen or so people in their 20s and 30s live together. Most have their own one-bedroom apartment, but they share food expenses, cooking responsibilities and an outdoor space with a hot tub, fire pit and hammock. These days, they were working from home and following extremely strict Covid protocols.As a researcher who studies romantic relationships, I have always been intrigued by this kind of arrangement. Modern couples expect to get all of their needs met by one romantic partner, but that can put a lot of pressure on the relationship. In 2015, a team of psychologists, led by Elaine Cheung, found that relying on different people for discrete needs leads to happier relationships. Eli Finkel, another psychologist, coined a name for them: OSOs (Other Significant Others).An OSO can be a friend or family member who fulfills a need that your significant other cannot: a triathlete who exercises with you because your partner doesn’t, or a sibling you call to vent about work because your significant other hates corporate politics. This web of support is not new, but for many of us it has been lost.For couples to survive and thrive, they need OSOs. That’s especially true during nightmarish years like the one Scott and I faced, which was exacerbated by the pandemic separating us from our normal network of support.That evening, as we sat at a picnic table at Radish, one of the residents brought out roasted asparagus, a salad topped with seeds and berries, and a platter of sweet potatoes — a stark contrast to all that cold pizza and hospital food. As I ate and laughed, I felt happy and relaxed for the first time in months.When we got into the car to drive home, I said to Scott, “We should move here.”Scott and I are career-driven professionals. Living in a commune had not exactly been our life plan. Then again, none of this had been. So we adjusted. And after months of losses, we finally got a win: Radish had a one-bedroom, first-floor apartment opening up. Three weeks later we moved in.Life at Radish has felt like turning on the lights after months of living in the dark. My new, bigger family and I have cooked elaborate dinners, commiserated about challenging co-workers and spent hours wilting in the hot tub.Scott was still mostly confined to the hospital, but for me, instead of returning home from visits to a pizza-stained rug, I was welcomed with hugs and tea. And Scott got regular visits from many more significant others than me.One rare Sunday morning when Scott was back home, I jumped into the shower before he woke up. There, against the stark white of the porcelain, were clumps of short red hair. I cleaned them up and crawled back into bed, where he turned to me, half-asleep, and said, “My hair is falling out.”“I know.”“I don’t want the nurses to shave it off with a dull razor,” he said. In the morning, he would be returning to the hospital for another week of chemo.I’d had the strength to push through the foot roast and last-minute wedding, but something about his hair falling out really broke me, perhaps because I love his red hair so much. So I texted the group, and within minutes we decided to create a hair-shaving ceremony.That evening, Misha D.J.ed songs from the musical “Hair” while Lauren ran a slide show of sexy bald men behind him. We all took turns shaving Scott’s head, moving through a series of faux hawks and mohawks before it all disappeared.Hearing Scott laugh, I knew we would make it. I had known, in theory, about the importance of having OSOs in your life, but now I was surviving thanks to them.One morning not long ago, when I was poaching eggs in the communal kitchen, Scott texted: “Where are my right shoes?”I hadn’t imagined he would ever need them again, but of course he would, for his prosthetic. His first fitting was in the morning. Our housemate, Alex — who, unlike me, is a sports hardware engineer — had signed up to take him.Logan Ury is the director of relationship science at Hinge.

	<title>Wall Street Journal Editorial Urges Trump to Resign to Avoid Impeachment</title>
	<author>Michael M. Grynbaum</author>
	<body>The editorial board of The Wall Street Journal, the American flagship of Rupert Murdoch’s newspaper empire, denounced President Trump on Thursday for inciting a mob of his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol and encouraged Mr. Trump to resign from office to prevent a second impeachment by the Democratic-controlled House.In an unsigned article with the headline “Donald Trump’s Final Days,” The Journal’s editorial page — a bellwether for the conservative establishment — excoriated the president for “an assault on the constitutional process of transferring power after an election” and said “this week has probably finished him as a serious political figure.” It described his behavior as “impeachable.”“If Mr. Trump wants to avoid a second impeachment, his best path would be to take personal responsibility and resign,” The Journal wrote, concluding, “It is best for everyone, himself included, if he goes away quietly.”The Journal’s editorial page, led by the editor Paul A. Gigot, has criticized Mr. Trump in the past, sometimes harshly. But its latest salvo was a striking repudiation of the president from a news outlet controlled by Mr. Murdoch, whose Fox News cable network is home to several of Mr. Trump’s most loyal and longstanding media defenders.Mr. Murdoch’s publicists had previously indicated that he did not expect Mr. Trump to win re-election, and another Murdoch publication, The New York Post, trumpeted President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory even as Mr. Trump refused to accept the results.The Post, in its own unsigned editorial on Thursday, stopped short of arguing that Mr. Trump should prematurely exit the White House, instead urging his aides “to stay and stop the crazy.” But given Mr. Murdoch’s influence on his newspapers’ political views, The Journal’s blunt words on Thursday were sure to sting Mr. Trump, who once craved the mogul’s approval.The president received kinder treatment on Fox News on Wednesday night, when prime-time hosts like Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham criticized the day’s violence at the Capitol but refrained from placing blame on Mr. Trump.A representative for Mr. Murdoch did not respond on Thursday to an inquiry for comment.The Journal’s editorial page found common ground with Mr. Trump throughout his presidency, and several of its prominent writers resigned in protest over what they deemed a betrayal of the page’s conservative values. (One defector, Bret Stephens, is now an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times.)The page has also routinely needled liberals. Last month, an outcry ensued after The Journal published an op-ed article arguing that Mr. Biden’s wife, Jill Biden, should drop the honorific “Dr.” from her name because she holds a doctorate in education, not a medical degree.Even in its castigation of Mr. Trump, which was to be published in Friday’s print edition, Mr. Gigot and his staff took time to knock Democrats for impeaching the president last year over what the paper deemed merely “ham-handed” offenses, saying the party had “abused the process.”But this week’s events in Washington, the paper wrote, showed that Mr. Trump “has refused to accept the basic bargain of democracy, which is to accept the result, win or lose.”“The best case for impeachment is not to punish Mr. Trump,” the paper wrote. “It is to send a message to future presidents that Congress will protect itself from populists of all ideological stripes willing to stir up a mob.”</body>

	<title>A Real Head-Scratcher</title>
	<author>Deb Amlen</author>
	<body>FRIDAY PUZZLE — When we last saw Evan Kalish, he was switching things up in a collaboration with Caitlin Reid.In this puzzle, Mr. Kalish offers us a themeless adventure that contains toeholds galore for the newer late-week solver. Some veteran solvers may have found this one on the easy side, but for my money, the trade-off in excellent fill was worth it. There is a lot to like here.“The Codebreaker,” based on the life of the cryptologist Elizebeth Smith Friedman, premieres on Monday on PBS, PBS.org and the PBS Video app. Check your local PBS listings for show times.Based on the book “The Woman Who Smashed Codes: A True Story of Love, Spies, and the Unlikely Heroine Who Outwitted America’s Enemies,” the documentary reveals the fascinating story of Ms. Friedman, the groundbreaking analyst whose painstaking work to decode thousands of messages for the U.S. government would send infamous gangsters to prison in the 1930s and bring down a massive, near-invisible Nazi spy ring in World War II. Together with her husband, the cryptologist William Friedman, Elizebeth helped develop the methods that led to the creation of the powerful new science of cryptology and laid the foundation for modern code breaking.If you were lucky enough to see the constructor and magician David Kwong’s Off Broadway show, “The Enigmatist,” this story about Riverbank Laboratories and the woman who unearthed a ring of Nazis should be familiar.There is some terrific wordplay in this puzzle. Read the clues carefully!1A. The slogan for Mountain Dew soda is “DO THE DEW.”16A. Nice wordplay. One way to “make one's hair stand on end” is to TEASE it.17A. “Welcome abroad” looks an awful lot like “welcome aboard,” but this clue is really asking you for a way to say “welcome” overseas. One way is to say BIENVENUE.19A. Another tricky one. At first reading, “Tours can be found on it” sounds like a place where someone can find a guided tour. Not in this puzzle, my friends. This is the city of Tours in France, and it can be found on the LOIRE river.28A. Thanks for the shout-out, Mr. Kalish. “The Gray Lady,” when abbreviated, is NYT, for The New York Times.29A. This does not refer to a cooking show on TV. “Curry on TV” hints at the newswoman ANN Curry.37A. What a great banner entry to stretch across the center of the grid. THIS GUY GETS IT, as you probably imagined, is a debut. And the fact that it crosses WOULDN’T YOU AGREE is just icing on the cake.41A. Most of the time, “A real head-scratcher?” is a conundrum, but this clue is hinting at actual head scratching, and the answer is NOOGIE.4D. I can remember going shopping with my mother as a child at HENRI Bendel’s department store.9D. It sounds as if “It can help you find your balance” might be hinting at a cane or some other type of stability tool, but this balance is a bank balance. The answer is ATM.11D. I will freely admit that I did not see this one coming, at least not until I got the final I from 37A. A “digital filing service?” is not about tax returns; it refers to fingers and toes, and the answer is MANI PEDI.30D. These clues are deadly if you haven’t seen them before. If this were a query about whose side you were on, “Friend or foe” would be asked in the form of a question, and it would probably be written as a verbalization, in quotes. This clue is asking for something different. It’s asking you to name the part of speech that either “friend” or “foe” is. Each word is a NOUN.60D. “Good name for” clues ask the solver to think of a proper name that would relate to the stated occupation. So, a “Good name for a marine biologist” would be RAY.It’s always an honor to get to share a themeless crossword with you. To me, a freestyle grid is a blank canvas for a fireworks display, and my goal is to pack as many novel and interesting entries into it as possible, without compromising fill quality. My favorite crossword entries tend to be common, evocative, yet cruciverbally overlooked spoken phrases, and this puzzle accommodated several I’d been itching to unveil.I was pleased to get to reference several accomplished women in this puzzle, including Edna Lewis and Zaha Hadid, the first woman to win architecture’s Pritzker Prize. (I love architecture.) I hope the crossing between LAHTI and HADID was manageable, if you weren’t familiar with either name.Thanks to the editors for several of the fun clues, including 16-Across and 11- and 34-Down. And who doesn’t love a Baby Yoda reference? Hope you enjoyed the puzzle!Almost finished solving but need a bit more help? We’ve got you covered.Warning: There be spoilers ahead, but subscribers can take a peek at the answer key.Trying to get back to the puzzle page? Right here.Your thoughts?</body>

	<title>‘Senate Being Locked Down’: Inside a Harrowing Day at the Capitol</title>
	<author>Emily Cochrane</author>
	<body>[Follow our live news coverage on the protests at the Capitol and across the country.]WASHINGTON — Something was not right inside the Senate chamber.Below the press balcony where I stood, looking down on the room like a fishbowl, Vice President Mike Pence had just been rushed out without explanation.“We do have an emergency,” bellowed a police officer with a neon sash who had appeared in the middle of the chamber. Officers and doorkeepers raced around, slamming and locking the immense wooden doors. There were panicked cries for senators to move further into the room.Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, threw up his hands in exasperation.“This is what you’ve gotten, guys,” he yelled, referring to a dozen or so Republican colleagues who were challenging President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory, which Congress was meeting to affirm.Now everything had ground to a halt and I had about 10 seconds to decide whether to run out or get locked in myself. I stayed, deciding I should keep my eyes on the senators I was there to cover, no matter what came next.“Senate being locked down,” I texted my editor.One minute later: “This is frightening.”Senator Patrick Leahy, an avid amateur photographer, snapped a few frames. Senator Amy Klobuchar blurted out that shots might have been fired. A hush fell over the room and sirens wailed outside.In an instant, Capitol Police officers began herding the lawmakers down into the well of the Senate and moving them out a back door.“What about us?” someone near me yelled from the balcony. The police shouted for us to get to the basement.I dashed to grab my laptop and plunged with a handful of reporters down three floors, where a lone officer held back a pair of doors leading to the Capitol Visitor Center, built after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks as an underground fortress of sorts. It, too, had been breached.Looking left, we saw a stream of senators snaking out ahead into the narrow subterranean tunnels that connect the sprawling Capitol campus.There was Senator Mitch McConnell, 78, the majority leader and a polio survivor, practically being carried by his security detail, their hands beneath his arms to steady him as they hustled along. The body man for Senator Chuck Schumer of New York had a firm grasp on his suit behind his neck. Trying to keep the mood light, Senator Roy Blunt from my home state of Missouri teased that perhaps the interruption would speed up the debate.When we came up above ground, we were in a space I knew well from years of work on Capitol Hill, but officers implored us not to share details of our location. We would be there for about four hours. Later, after the Capitol had been cleared and secured, we retraced our steps, along with staff aides who carried two mahogany boxes containing the Electoral College certificates.As Congress resumed its count and night turned to early morning, I found myself wandering alone through an eerily silent Capitol, studying the remains of an abandoned occupation. The ornate tiled floors, one of the building’s treasures, were coated in a powdery residue of fire extinguishers and pepper spray.The window entering the Speaker’s Lobby, where I’ve spent hours cornering lawmakers was shattered. Benches were upturned. Soft drinks littered the halls. On the first floor, I found a handful of syringes and a defibrillator spent on someone — I wondered who — and left behind. —Nicholas Fandos, congressional reporterI could hear protesters on the first floor of the Senate side of the Capitol, so I went downstairs, following the noise. They came up to the Ohio Clock Corridor just outside the chamber where senators were meeting, and were yelling that they wanted to get in. I was shocked they’d made it inside, and thought this would be the big moment of the day: a small group of protesters having breached the Capitol building.I was wrong.I looked down the hall to the Rotunda and saw what looked like a hundred people running around, yelling and pulling around a podium. I took a bunch of photos and then went to the ceremonial doors to the Rotunda, where a single police officer guarded the door against a throng of hundreds outside.The mob massed together and rushed the officer, forcing open the door, and people flooded in. I ran upstairs to be out of the way of the crowd, and to get a better vantage point to document what was happening. Suddenly, two or three men in black surrounded me and demanded to know who I worked for.Grabbing my press pass, they saw that my ID said The New York Times and became really angry. They threw me to the floor, trying to take my cameras. I started screaming for help as loudly as I could. No one came. People just watched. At this point, I thought I could be killed and no one would stop them. They ripped one of my cameras away from me, broke a lens on the other and ran away.After that I was hyperventilating, unsure of what to do. I knew I needed to get away from the mob and hide my broken camera so I wouldn’t be targeted again. I ran into Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s suite, but people were vandalizing her office, so I kept moving. Walking out to her balcony facing west toward the National Mall, I saw a mass of people covering the inaugural stage. I found a spot to hide my camera in there, then stood watching the crowd from the balcony and filming from my phone, which was all I had left.“This will be the start of a civil war revolution,” a man next to me said.At that point, the Capitol Police had started deploying pepper spray or tear gas, and I knew I needed to find a place to hide. I didn’t know where I could go since I no longer had my congressional credentials. I ran to the third floor, opened the first door I saw and hid in a hallway. I called my husband, who told me to stay calm and find a safer spot.But then the police found me. I told them that I was a photojournalist and that my pass had been stolen, but they didn’t believe me. They drew their guns, pointed them and yelled at me to get down on my hands and knees. As I lay on the ground, two other photojournalists came into the hall and started shouting “She’s a journalist!”The officers told us it wasn’t safe to leave, and helped us find a room to barricade ourselves in. The two other photographers grabbed my hands and told me it would be OK, and to stay with them so they could vouch for me. I’ll never forget their kindness in that moment. —Erin Schaff, staff photographerA little after 2:15 p.m., aides in the House chamber began quietly warning us to prepare to take shelter. I thought about how stupid I was to have left my bag at my desk on the opposite end of the Capitol, and asked to borrow someone’s computer charger just in case.Debating a criminal referral. The Jan. 6 House committee has grown divided over whether to make a criminal referral of former President Donald J. Trump to the Justice Department, even though it has concluded that it has enough evidence to do so. The debate centers on whether a referral would backfire by politically tainting the expanding federal investigation.Cooperating with investigators. Pat A. Cipollone and Patrick F. Philbi, two of Mr. Trump’s top White House lawyers, met with the Jan. 6 House committee, while Ali Alexander, a prominent organizer of pro-Trump events after the 2020 election, said he would assist in the federal investigation.Contempt charges. The House voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino Jr., two close allies of Mr. Trump, after the pair defied subpoenas from the special committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.I watched as a security detail rushed Representative Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, off the floor along with other members of leadership. Police officers began to shut the gallery doors.“We now have individuals that have breached the Capitol building,” said a Capitol Police officer who had stepped up to the rostrum. Remain inside and calm, he instructed.I just kept updating my story, needing something to keep me distracted. Lawmakers were yelling. It didn’t feel real.Tear gas had been deployed in the Rotunda, an officer said, and everyone needed to grab an emergency hood from under his or her chair and prepare to put it on.Suddenly, it seemed as if every lawmaker had a duffel bag in hand, pulling out aluminum bags and emergency hoods, and staff members were distributing them out to reporters.You could hear banging outside, so I crouched behind a desk, the reality of the chamber being breached sinking in. I ripped at the bag, struggling to pull out the hood, a sort of hybrid gas mask with a tarp, which made a loud whirring noise and had a flashing red light. I peeked over the desk and could see Representative Ruben Gallego, Democrat of Arizona and a veteran, jacketless, standing on a chair and yelling instructions on how to use the masks.Officers hauled a huge wooden chest as a makeshift barricade in front of the main doors to the House chamber — the ones Vice President Mike Pence had just walked through, the ones through which they had carried the chests with the elector certificates. The floor was empty, except for staff aides yelling at everyone in the gallery to get out.I grabbed my laptop, my phone and this whirring hood, clutched it all to my chest, and clambered up to the back of the gallery where a line was forming to leave the chamber. There was a banister separating the area into sections and we struggled to climb over. What’s faster? Ducking under? Climbing over? As I plotted my escape, I heard shouts of “Get down!” Everyone dropped to the floor.Face down behind an auditorium chair, I could see a few officers with guns drawn at the barricaded chamber doors. Representative Markwayne Mullin, Republican of Oklahoma, was trying to reason with whomever was banging on the door. I started thinking about how I really wasn’t shielded behind this chair. Was it worth scuttling down a few steps to see if the TV equipment provided more cover? But then would I be more exposed if people started shooting? I stayed put.I sent a few “I love you” texts, otherwise frozen on the ground. I didn’t know what might happen. I just wanted them to know. —Emily Cochrane, congressional reporter</body>

	<title>California is loosening its vaccine eligibility rules.</title>
	<author>Will Wright</author>
	<body>California, confronting its worst surge of coronavirus infections yet, is loosening its vaccine protocol in an effort to avoid wasting Covid-19 vaccines.The state Health Department has expanded its definition of health care workers. It now includes community health care workers, public health field staff members, and people who work at primary care clinics, specialty clinics and dental clinics, as well as lab workers and pharmacy staff.If extra vaccines remain or doses are on the verge of expiring, people who work in education, child care, emergency services and food agriculture will also be eligible, the state said.According to a New York Times database, only 1.3 percent of the state’s population — 528,173 people — has received a shot. California wants to administer vaccines to a million more people over the next 10 days.On Wednesday, California reported 36,672 new Covid-19 cases and 554 new deaths, according to a New York Times database.The shift in vaccine rules came days after a freezer at a Northern California hospital storing 830 doses of the Moderna vaccine failed, leaving the hospital staff scrambling to use the doses before they expired without violating the protocols.Around the country, vaccine distribution efforts have proceeded at a trickle.In Florida, amid concerns about a turbulent rollout, Gov. Ron DeSantis visited two vaccination sites on Thursday to talk to the state’s large population of elderly people about when they would get the coveted vaccines.Florida had vaccinated nearly 2 percent of its population — just over 400,000 people — as of Thursday.State officials prioritized health care workers and residents of long term care facilities in their vaccination plan. But the rollout has been bumpy.On Tuesday, local media reported that older residents had camped out in endless lines at Daytona Stadium to get a shot. The wait was said to be 12 hours or more.Dr. Nicole M. Iovine, the chief epidemiology officer at the University of Florida Health Shands Hospital, said the high demand was “a good problem to have.” The state’s ability to speed up its distribution will largely depend on how many doses are available, she said.“Given all the complexities of what’s happening here, I think we’re going in the right direction,” Dr. Iovine said. “Help is coming, the vaccine is coming, and as hard as it is to say, ‘Be patient,’ that’s really the message we have to put out there.”</body>

	<title>These Are the Rioters Who Stormed the Nation’s Capitol</title>
	<author>Matthew Rosenberg</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — There were infamous white nationalists and noted conspiracy theorists who have spread dark visions of pedophile Satanists running the country. Others were more anonymous, people who had journeyed from Indiana and South Carolina to heed President Trump’s call to show their support. One person, a West Virginia lawmaker, had only been elected to office in November.All of them converged on Wednesday on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol, where hundreds of rioters crashed through barricades, climbed through windows and walked through doors, wandering around the hallways with a sense of gleeful desecration, because, for a few breathtaking hours, they believed that they had displaced the very elites they said they hated.“We wanted to show these politicians that it’s us who’s in charge, not them,” said a construction worker from Indianapolis, who is 40 and identified himself only as Aaron. He declined to give his last name, saying, “I’m not that dumb.”He added: “We’ve got the strength.”As the country sifts through the shards of what happened in Washington on Wednesday, what comes into focus in the storming of the Capitol is a jumbled constellation of hard-core Trump supporters: a largely white crowd, many of them armed with bats, shields and chemical spray; some carried Confederate flags and wore costumes of fur and horns inspired by QAnon; they were mostly men but there were women, too.Those who stormed the Capitol were just one slice of the thousands of Trump supporters who had descended on Washington to protest the certification of Joseph R. Biden’s victory in November over President Trump. Their breach came with a confused and frenzied energy, fueled by the words of Mr. Trump just minutes before and the fervor of the mob standing behind them.Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department said it had made no additional arrests on Thursday connected to the rioting, during which one woman was fatally shot by the Capitol Police and a Capitol Police officer suffered injuries from which he later died. A day earlier they detained 68 people, plus the 14 picked up by the Capitol Police during the unrest. Dozens more people were still being sought by federal authorities. Their number included a 60-year-old gun rights activist from Arkansas who was pictured sitting in Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office, men in tactical gear taking selfies in the Rotunda and a woman carrying a QAnon-inspired sign about children in the House chamber.Some of those who had also surged forward in the crowd seemed to show a bewildered wonder at what they were seeing in front of them. A few remarked on the opulence of the Capitol building and offices, a quality that seemed to confirm their suspicions about the corruption of Washington.“Yeah look at all this fancy furniture they have,” said a man in a winter parka and red hat, standing on the west side of the Capitol and peering through the glass at empty desks, computer screens and ergonomic chairs. Several people banged on the windows with their fists, including one man who shouted, “Put the coffee on!” One man hit his head, not seeing the outer layer of glass was there, it was so clean.As people rushed inside, there was a strange mix of confusion and excitement, and the almost complete lack of police presence in the beginning amplified the feeling of lawlessness. They gawked at a place of wealth and beauty, adorned with art and marble, a domain of the powerful, and for a short while on Wednesday afternoon, the rioters were in control. For once, they felt, they could not be ignored.Aaron, the construction worker from Indianapolis, and his two friends had heard people talking about going to Ms. Pelosi’s office. So once inside they decided to instead find Senator Chuck Schumer’s office. Both are Democrats.“We wanted to have a few words” with Mr. Schumer, he said. “He’s probably the most corrupt guy up here. You don’t hear too much about him. But he’s slimy. You can just see it.”But they could not find Mr. Schumer’s office. He said they asked a Capitol Police officer, who tried to direct them. But they appeared to have gotten nowhere near the minority’s leader’s office. They ended up smoking a few cigarettes inside the building — “We can smoke in our house,” Aaron said — and one of his friends, who would not give his name, joked that he had gone to the bathroom and not flushed.A woman in a coat sat on the couch in a small room with a blue carpet and watched as a man ripped a scroll with Chinese lettering hanging on the wall.“We don’t want Chinese bullshit,” the woman said.Nearby, six men sat at a large wooden desk. A lamp with a white shade was knocked over and broken. Someone was smoking pot. “This is the pot room!” a young man said.In the Crypt, people walked around taking photographs of the statues and themselves with their phones. One man had a selfie stick, like a tourist in a foreign land. A woman in baggy jeans, a blue puffer jacket, was shouting chants into a megaphone, while a man in a black T-shirt that read “Not Today Liberal” ran around the central columns in what looked like a frenetic victory lap.Representative Bennie G. Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi and chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said on Thursday that the F.B.I. and the Transportation Security Administration should add the names of anyone who had entered the Capitol building during the mob attack to the federal no-fly list.“We already saw reports of ‘unruly mobs’ in air on the way to Washington, D.C.,” Mr. Thompson said in a statement. “It does not take much imagination to envision how they might act out on their way out of D.C. if allowed to fly unfettered.”As the authorities try to identify those in the mob, some will be less hard to pin down than others. The group included some well-known figures from the conspiratorial right, including Jake Angeli, who has pushed the false QAnon claims that Mr. Trump was elected to save America from deep-state bureaucrats and prominent Democrats who worship Satan and abuse children. He was pictured sitting in Congress in a viking helmet and furs. Mr. Angeli, who is known as the “Q Shaman,” has been a fixture in the pro-Trump protests in Arizona since the election, and there are indications that he and other right-wing activists had planned to spark a confrontation with authorities ahead of Wednesday’s rally.There were also leaders from the Proud Boys, a far-right group whose participants have espoused misogynistic and anti-immigrant views, such as Nick Ochs, a failed Hawaii state legislature candidate and member of a collective called “Murder the Media.” Chris Hood and members of his National Socialist Club, a neo-Nazi group, posted photos on Telegram from outside the Capitol on Wednesday. And the Three Percenters, a far-right armed group, were seen gathered in Washington’s Freedom Plaza on Tuesday night, most wearing helmets and Kevlar vest adorned with the group’s symbol, a Roman numeral three.The mob came from the broader crowd, tens of thousands of Mr. Trump’s most loyal supporters, many of whom had driven through the night, or taken buses with friends and neighbors, to watch him speak and be part of a day that many hoped would finally hold some answers to what had been months of false claims that the election had been stolen. A number of people interviewed said they had never been to Washington before.In interviews on Wednesday, protesters in the broader crowd expressed a sense that something would happen — something that was bigger than they were. What exactly it would be no one could say. Before the Capitol was stormed, some hinted darkly about violence and the looming threat of civil war. But when pressed for what that might mean, they tended to demur, saying simply that, if called, they would serve their side in a conflict.Debating a criminal referral. The Jan. 6 House committee has grown divided over whether to make a criminal referral of former President Donald J. Trump to the Justice Department, even though it has concluded that it has enough evidence to do so. The debate centers on whether a referral would backfire by politically tainting the expanding federal investigation.Cooperating with investigators. Pat A. Cipollone and Patrick F. Philbi, two of Mr. Trump’s top White House lawyers, met with the Jan. 6 House committee, while Ali Alexander, a prominent organizer of pro-Trump events after the 2020 election, said he would assist in the federal investigation.Contempt charges. The House voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino Jr., two close allies of Mr. Trump, after the pair defied subpoenas from the special committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.“There’s been lots of people talking about this day coming for a long time,” said Brian Sachtleben, 40, an asphalt truck driver from a small town near Sheboygan, Wis., who was looking at the sea of people spreading from the Washington Monument to the Ellipse, marveling at the numbers, shortly before Mr. Trump began to speak.When asked what he thought might happen, he said: “I don’t know. I really don’t know.”He referred cryptically to the Thomas Jefferson quote: “The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.”Then he added: “I don’t think anything is going to be back to normal ever again.”He left town before the violence began.When those who entered the Capitol later re-emerged after their rampage, many were welcomed like returning heroes.“Yeah, we stopped the vote!” screamed a man in a navy-blue zippered jacket, as he emerged, hands held high, from a tall yellow wooden door, as people outside whooped and cheered. “Murder the media” was scrawled in black marker across the other part of the double door.Many said they would not have tried to go in, but they sympathized with those who had.“I’m not going in there, but, yeah, I’m kind of OK with it,” said Lisa Todd, 56, a high school teacher from Raleigh, N.C. She was standing with three friends, all fellow teachers.Others expressed some regret.Storming the Capitol was “probably not the best thing to do,” said Eric Dark, 43, a truck driver from Braman, Okla., who was tear-gassed when he got to the top of the steps to the building but never made it inside.He had been standing with Brian Hobbs, the mayor of Newkirk, Okla., near the top of the steps on the western side of the building around 4:30 p.m. when officers in riot gear started moving to clear out the thousands of people who had gathered.It could have been a lot worse, Mr. Dark said.“We had enough people, we could have tore that building down brick by brick,” he said.</body>

	<title>In a new video, Trump addresses violence at the Capitol and says ‘a new administration’ will be sworn in.</title>
	<author>Zach Montague</author>
	<body>President Trump came the closest he has so far to a concession statement on Thursday in a videotaped address from the White House, a day after he had helped steer his supporters toward the Capitol, where they rioted and took over the building.After his Twitter account was locked on Wednesday and he was unable to post for nearly 24 hours, the president said that a “new administration” would be sworn in on Jan. 20 and that “serving as your president has been the honor of my lifetime.”He also condemned the violence that came shortly after he told his supporters to fight against the election results, falsely claimed that the vote had been stolen from him and said that Vice President Mike Pence could overturn the outcome.“This moment calls for healing and reconciliation,” Mr. Trump said, reading from a teleprompter.In his opening, Mr. Trump claimed that he “immediately deployed the National Guard” to “expel the intruders,” despite accounts from people familiar with the events saying he had resisted those calls and that it was, in fact, Mr. Pence who had ordered the National Guard to deploy.“The demonstrators who infiltrated the Capitol have defiled the seat of American democracy,” Mr. Trump said, a day after he had ended a video telling the rioters to “go home” but ended with, “I love you.”“You do not represent our country, and to those who broke the law, you will pay,” he said in the latest video.The video was vital in the sense that Mr. Trump’s ardent supporters will only accept his words, not anyone else’s, and officials throughout government are concerned about unrest for the next 13 days around the country. But the president has a long history of recording such videos only to undermine his own remarks a short time later.“Now tempers must be cooled, and calm restored,” he said. “We must get on with the business of America.”</body>

	<body>Last year effectively tied 2016 as the hottest year on record, European climate researchers announced Friday, as global temperatures continued their relentless rise brought on by the emission of heat-trapping greenhouse gases.The record warmth — which fueled deadly heat waves, droughts, intense wildfires and other environmental disasters around the world in 2020 — occurred despite the development in the second half of the year of La Niña, a global climate phenomenon marked by surface cooling across much of the equatorial Pacific Ocean.And while 2020 may tie the record, all of the last six years are among the hottest ever, said Freja Vamborg, a senior scientist with the Copernicus Climate Change Service.“It’s a reminder that temperatures are changing and will continue to change if we don’t cut greenhouse gas emissions,” Dr. Vamborg said.According to Copernicus, a program of the European Union, the global average temperature in 2020 was 1.25 degrees Celsius (about 2.25 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the average from 1850 to 1900, before the rise of emissions from spreading industrialization. The 2020 average was very slightly lower than the average in 2016, too small a difference to be significant.Some regions experienced exceptional warming. For the second year in a row, Europe had its warmest year ever, and suffered from deadly heat waves. But the temperature difference between 2020 and 2019 was striking: 2020 was 0.4 degrees Celsius, or nearly three-quarters of a degree Fahrenheit, warmer.While not quite as drastic as in Europe, temperatures across North America were above average as well. The warming played a critical role in widespread drought that affected most of the western half of the United States and intense wildfires that ravaged California and Colorado.The Arctic is warming much faster than elsewhere, a characteristic that was reflected in the 2020 numbers. Average temperatures in some parts of the Arctic were more than 6 degrees Celsius higher last year than a baseline average from 1981 to 2010. Europe, by contrast, was 1.6 degrees Celsius higher last year than the same baseline.In the Arctic, and especially in parts of Siberia, abnormally warm conditions persisted through most of the year. The heat led to drying of vegetation that in Siberia helped fuel one of the most intensive wildfire seasons in history.Parts of the Southern Hemisphere experienced lower than average temperatures, possibly as a result of the arrival of La Niña conditions in the second half of 2020.Dr. Vamborg said that it is difficult to attribute any temperature differences directly to La Niña, but the cooling effect of the phenomenon may be why December 2020, when La Niña was strengthening, was only the sixth warmest December ever, while most of the other months of the year were in the top three.Zeke Hausfather, a research scientist at Berkeley Earth, an independent research group in California, said the greatest effect of La Niña on global temperatures tends to come several months after conditions peak in the Pacific. “So while certainly La Niña had some cooling effect in the last few months, it’s likely going to have a bigger impact on 2021 temperatures,” he said.Dr. Hausfather said it was striking that 2020 matched 2016, because that year’s record warmth was fueled by El Niño. El Niño is essentially the opposite of La Niña, when surface warming in the Pacific tends to supercharge global temperatures.So 2020 and 2016 being equally warm, Dr. Hausfather said, means that the last five years of global warming have had a cumulative effect that is about the same as El Niño.Berkeley Earth will release its own analysis of 2020 global temperatures later this month, as will the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA. The three analyses take a similar approach, essentially compiling thousands of temperature measurements worldwide.Copernicus employs a technique called re-analysis, which uses fewer temperature measurements but adds other weather data like air pressure, and feeds it all into a computer model to come up with its temperature averages.Despite the differences, the results of the analyses tend to be very similar.</body>

	<title>Less Than Two Weeks to Go</title>
	<author>The Editorial Board</author>
	<body>The most pressing issue facing the nation right now is how to grind out the closing days of the Trump era without further irreparable harm to the Republic. No more Americans should have to lose their lives to a transition of presidential power.Starting Wednesday evening and on into Thursday, teams of workers were cleaning the broken glass and the leftover film of tear gas from the floor of the U.S. Capitol. Graffiti was being scoured from walls. Discarded Trump flags and plastic water bottles and broken furniture were being collected. With impressive efficiency, the visible wreckage from Wednesday’s assault on the heart of American democracy is being cleared away.But the wounds to the nation remain, as does the specter of further unrest. America is in uncharted, unsettling territory. What happens when a sitting president incites thousands of his followers to attack the government that he ostensibly leads? There is deep division even about what to call the events that unfolded: A failed coup? An insurrection? Domestic terrorism?The country is in for much soul-searching and fact-finding about precisely how the attack was allowed to happen. The failures of the Capitol Police, for starters, demand scrutiny. There also will be many long-term, big-picture challenges to tackle, including how to begin reabsorbing back into a reality-based civil society the millions of Trump supporters who have been radicalized by the president’s campaign of lies and truly believe that an overwhelming win for Joe Biden was a victory stolen from Donald Trump.The storming of the people’s house by extremists — some of them armed, all of them spurred on by the wild ravings of a defeated man who cannot face reality — stunned the world. For a few hours, it seemed as though the whole country might go mad. Reports were rolling in of pro-Trump protesters descending on government buildings in Washington, Kansas, Nevada, New Mexico, Minnesota, Colorado and beyond. That many of the seditionists wore ridiculous costumes and seemed more like hooligans than committed revolutionaries does not make what happened any less horrifying.For all its horror — including the fatal shooting of one woman who broke into the Capitol and the death of a police officer who was at the scene — the chaos was short-lived. But the underlying rage continues to percolate.In the wake of the attack, major social media platforms suspended Mr. Trump’s accounts — some more temporarily than others. This was the responsible thing to do. Lowering the temperature is an admirable goal, even after years of these companies profiting from raising it. But it obviously does not solve the problem.Mr. Trump is still the president, even if not for long. The potential for him to wreak additional havoc is enormous. Just ask the 10 former secretaries of defense who felt moved to issue a statement this week warning the president not to drag the military into his election dispute.There’s no doubt that Mr. Trump is responsible for the riot at the Capitol. But the blame rests as well with the Republican officials who humored him — specifically, the 139 House members and eight senators who gave his voter-fraud fantasies substance by voting to overturn the results of an election that was as free as it was fair. Their assault on democracy should be not be forgotten.The bigger issue, however, is whether they, and other Americans in positions of power, are willing to finally take a stand against the president’s perfidy. His lies won’t stop. Yet the violence must end.There are growing calls for Mr. Trump to be removed from office, if not by impeachment then perhaps by invocation of the 25th Amendment. Vice President Mike Pence is said to oppose this effort. But he and the president’s cabinet members have the responsibility to give it serious consideration. If those closest to Mr. Trump believe that he is in crisis and unable to fulfill the duties of his office — that he perhaps has become an acute threat to the nation — they have a duty to take action. The events of this week have shown all too vividly what can happen when public leaders do not put the public good ahead of politics.Alternatively, it may be determined that criminal indictment is the more appropriate recourse. Mr. Trump’s actions in recent days may well run afoul of laws against insurrection or incitement. One top federal prosecutor hasn’t ruled out the idea. Such a remedy would extend beyond his time in office.In less than two weeks, America will officially scrape the mud of the Trump presidency from its shoe. But the president and his supporters have shown themselves willing to burn down the house on his way out. Preventing this should be the chief focus of the nation’s leaders — most especially those who have coddled and enabled him to push the nation to the brink.A safe and peaceful transition of power should be the top priority of every American.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

	<title>Justice Dept. Open to Pursuing Charges Against Trump in Inciting Riot</title>
	<author>Katie Benner</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — The Justice Department said on Thursday that it would not rule out pursuing charges against President Trump for his possible role in inciting the mob that marched to the Capitol, overwhelmed officers and stormed the building a day earlier.“We are looking at all actors, not only the people who went into the building,” Michael Sherwin, the U.S. attorney in Washington, told reporters.Mr. Sherwin was asked whether such targets would include Mr. Trump, who exhorted supporters during a rally near the White House, telling them that they could never “take back our country with weakness.” Propelled by Mr. Trump’s baseless claims of election irregularities, the protesters had gathered to demonstrate against Congress’s certification of Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s Electoral College victory and moved on to the Capitol after the president’s rally.Mr. Sherwin said he stood by his statement. “We’re looking at all actors,” he said. “If the evidence fits the elements of a crime, they’re going to be charged.”His comments were an extraordinary invocation of the rule of law against a president who has counted on the Justice Department to advance his personal agenda, and they came as former Trump officials and others condemned Mr. Trump’s actions. Former cabinet officials including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Attorney General William P. Barr, once one of the president’s most important defenders, blamed him for Wednesday’s violence. Several officials resigned, and even some Republican lawmakers said Mr. Trump had gone too far.The Justice Department generally asserts that sitting presidents cannot be charged with a crime, but that protection covers Mr. Trump for only 13 more days.Mr. Biden, who has said he has no appetite to investigate and prosecute the Trump administration, unequivocally blamed Mr. Trump on Thursday for “trying to use a mob to silence the voices of nearly 160 million Americans” who voted in the presidential election.He said that Mr. Trump had treated Mr. Barr and the Justice Department “as his personal lawyer and the department as his personal law firm,” and said that Judge Merrick B. Garland, his own nominee to be the next attorney general, would need to restore rule of law.“There is no more important place for us to do this work than the Department of Justice that has been so politicized,” Mr. Biden said. “We need to restore the honor, the integrity, the independence of the Department of Justice in this nation that’s been so badly damaged.”The Justice Department faces the daunting task of prosecuting a large number of people who broke into the Capitol, since the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington acts as the main prosecutor for the District of Columbia.Mr. Sherwin said his prosecutors and the city’s Metropolitan Police Department were working around the clock to identify and arrest suspects. He complained that their job was made harder because the U.S. Capitol Police did not detain most of the rioters who forced their way into the building.“The scenario has made our job difficult,” Mr. Sherwin said, noting that the police, F.B.I. agents, counterterrorism investigators and other law enforcement officials now had to rely on social media posts and video footage to identify suspects. “That has made things challenging.”He said the Capitol Police had not explained why they arrested only 14 people and let hundreds more peacefully walk out of the building. The chief of the Capitol Police, Steven Sund, resigned on Thursday, amid questions about his force’s failure to protect the building.In all, prosecutors have filed 40 cases in Superior Court on charges including unlawful entry, assault and firearms offenses, and they were preparing to file complaints for 15 federal criminal cases all related to the breach of the Capitol, including unauthorized entry, illegal possession of a firearm and theft of property.The city’s police also announced that they had arrested nearly 70 people at the riot on charges that included unlawful entry, illegal gun possession and assault.Debating a criminal referral. The Jan. 6 House committee has grown divided over whether to make a criminal referral of former President Donald J. Trump to the Justice Department, even though it has concluded that it has enough evidence to do so. The debate centers on whether a referral would backfire by politically tainting the expanding federal investigation.Cooperating with investigators. Pat A. Cipollone and Patrick F. Philbi, two of Mr. Trump’s top White House lawyers, met with the Jan. 6 House committee, while Ali Alexander, a prominent organizer of pro-Trump events after the 2020 election, said he would assist in the federal investigation.Contempt charges. The House voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino Jr., two close allies of Mr. Trump, after the pair defied subpoenas from the special committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.Rioters rifled through the offices of lawmakers and stole electronics, prosecutors said. Mr. Sherwin said that the theft of files and electronics opened the possibility of national security breaches but that the Justice Department did not yet have a full understanding of the scope of the problem.One federal complaint accused a man named Mark J. Leffingwell of assaulting a Capitol Police officer around 2:30 p.m. on Wednesday in a hallway in the Senate wing of the Capitol. The officer, Daniel Amendola, said in the complaint that Mr. Leffingwell was part of a crowd that had “breached a window.” When Officer Amendola sought to stop him and others from entering the building any further, Mr. Leffingwell punched him repeatedly in the head and chest, according to the complaint. Mr. Leffingwell then “spontaneously apologized.”Prosecutors also unsealed charges against a Maryland resident, Christopher Alberts, accusing him of illegally carrying a Taurus 9-millimeter pistol at the riot. Officers first saw Mr. Alberts leaving the Capitol complex around 7:30 p.m. and noticed a bulge on his right hip. When they stopped Mr. Alberts, the officers found the pistol, which had one round in the chamber and a magazine filled with 12 rounds, according to the complaint. They also discovered that he was wearing a bulletproof vest and had a gas mask in his backpack.After he was taken into custody, the complaint said, Mr. Alberts told the police that he had the weapon for “personal protection” and did not intend to harm anyone.Mr. Sherwin said he would not rule out investigations into Mr. Trump and his inner circle for their roles in the rioting, just as he would not rule out an investigation into anyone who may have assisted, facilitated or played an ancillary role in the events.“All options are on the table,” he said. “We will look at every actor and all criminal charges.”Mr. Trump is said to have discussed in recent weeks the possibility of pardoning himself, an unprecedented and untested use of presidential power, but it is uncertain whether that would ultimately protect him.Mr. Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., also told the crowd on Wednesday that Republicans in Congress should back Mr. Trump’s efforts to undo the election result: “We’re coming for you,” he said of lawmakers who refused. And Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, said that to win the election, his supporters would need to engage in “trial by combat” against Democrats.Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, called on Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday to invoke the 25th Amendment and immediately remove Mr. Trump for urging on the mob.That amendment would allow Mr. Pence and a majority of the cabinet to wrest the power of the presidency from Mr. Trump. But Mr. Pence is said to oppose such a move.Ms. Pelosi said Democrats were prepared to impeach Mr. Trump for a second time should Mr. Pence not act.Reporting was contributed by Charlie Savage, Alan Feuer, Thomas Kaplan and Michael Wines.</body>

	<title>A Capitol Police officer who was seriously injured Wednesday remains on life support.</title>
	<author>Michael Levenson</author>
	<body>A United States Capitol Police officer who was seriously injured during violent protests in Washington remained hospitalized on Thursday night, one day after the police were overwhelmed by a pro-Trump mob that stormed the Capitol and disrupted Congress.News media reports Thursday evening that the officer had died of his injuries were later contradicted by other reports quoting a Capitol Police spokesman and the head of the police union, Gus Papathanasiou, who told a Washington television station that the officer remained on life support.Four deaths have been linked to Wednesday’s mayhem. One protester was shot and killed by a Capitol Police officer inside the building, and three other people died after experiencing medical emergencies, officials said.The officer, whose name was not immediately released, had been hit with a fire extinguisher, two law enforcement officials said.A spokeswoman for the Capitol Police and the police officers’ union did not immediately respond to requests for more information on Thursday.Reports of the officer’s death spread after Representative Dean Phillips, Democrat of Minnesota, wrote on Twitter that he had “been advised a US Capitol Police officer has died of injuries sustained in yesterday’s assault on the Capitol.”“My heart goes out to the family of the officer and to all who risk their lives every day to protect and serve our communities with dignity and principle,” Mr. Phillips wrote.</body>

	<title>Late Night Is Unimpressed by Titanic-Fleeing Republicans </title>
	<author>unkown</author>
	<body>Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night’s highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. We’re all stuck at home at the moment, so here are the 50 best movies on Netflix right now.The late-night hosts were still reeling along with the rest of the country on Thursday, the day after a Trump-incited mob stormed the Capitol.“Well, guys, it’s been a pretty epic 24 hours,” Jimmy Fallon said at the top of “The Tonight Show.” “Joe Biden was certified as our next president, several staffers have resigned from the White House, Trump’s social media accounts were banned, and yet, compared to yesterday, it’s a slow news day.”“Since yesterday’s riot, resignations have poured in at the White House, and sources expect they’ll keep coming. Although resigning with two weeks left feels less like some moral stand and more like leaving early to beat traffic.” — JIMMY FALLON“My question is, how do you put in your two weeks’ notice when your job ends in less than two weeks?” — JIMMY FALLON“I’ve been watching the news, and these ‘experts’ keep saying ‘history will not look back kindly’ on the politicians who continue with this charade. As if those people care about history. Those people don’t even care about climate change. At this rate, we’ll be lucky if we even have a history for them to be ashamed of.” — JIMMY KIMMEL“Last night marked the end of the longtime romance between Donald Trump and his golden Graham, Lindsey, who used his time before the Senate last night to issue a very public breakup.” — JIMMY KIMMEL“Lindsey Graham said he and Trump ‘had a hell of a journey,’ but ‘enough is enough.’ And he decided not to give him the final rose.” — JIMMY KIMMEL“That was something to watch. I’d like to commend Senator Graham for this courageous act, two weeks after he called to try to get the Georgia secretary of state to change the election results. Now he’s appalled. But heroes come in many forms, folks.” — JIMMY KIMMEL“And after that ugly day yesterday, President Trump’s mental state has now come into question, with one senior adviser saying Trump has, quote, ‘lost it.’ I’ve got to say, it’s very brave of Republicans to start speaking out against Trump only 99.9 percent of the way through his term in office. You know, not to quibble about this, but for someone to ‘lose it,’ first they must ‘possess it,’ mustn’t they?’ — JAMES CORDEN“People were comparing this big wave of resignations to rats fleeing the Titanic, but I really don’t think that’s fair. At one point, the Titanic actually had some direction. It was going somewhere.”  — JAMES CORDEN“It makes sense, though. You want to get out into the job market before the Trump administration gets blocked on LinkedIn as well.” — JAMES CORDEN“Trump was suspended by Twitter. He’s blocked by Facebook and Instagram, too. Still on Match.com.” — JIMMY KIMMEL“Well, yesterday we learned that if you incite a coup against the U.S. government, you will face up to 12 hours without a Twitter account.” — SETH MEYERS“Aside from his fear of removal or prosecution, maybe baby just wants his toy back, because Twitter locked the president’s account after his riot on Capitol Hill. Good to know Twitter is finally treating a violence-inciting fascist as harshly as a teenager who used seven seconds of an Imagine Dragons song.” — STEPHEN COLBERT“He also got blocked from posting to Facebook and Instagram indefinitely. YouTube pulled his video address to the rioters, citing election misinformation, and Amazon banned him from ordering Pixy Stix because they get him too wound up before bedtime.” — STEPHEN COLBERT“In other news, guess who doesn’t want to ban TikTok anymore.” — JIMMY FALLONJulien Baker performed her timely new song “Faith Healer” on Thursday’s “Late Show.”Fran Lebowitz and Martin Scorsese reminisce about old New York in their new Netflix documentary series, “Pretend It’s a City.”</body>

	<title>We’ve Seen the Ugly Truth About America</title>
	<author>Roxane Gay</author>
	<body>There are two images. In one, National Guard troops, most with no identifying information on their uniforms, stand on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in anticipation of violence from people peacefully protesting the killing of George Floyd. In the second image, thousands of protesters — domestic terrorists, really — swarm the Capitol. They wear red MAGA hats and carry Trump flags and show their faces because they want to be seen. They don’t seem to fear the consequences of being identified. More images — a man sitting in Nancy Pelosi’s office, his feet on a desk, a smirk on his face. A man carrying a stolen lectern, smiling at the camera. A man in the Senate chamber doing parkour.On Wednesday, Jan. 6, Congress was set to conduct a largely ceremonial count of the electoral votes. There were rumblings that a few ambitious, craven politicians planned to object to the votes in several states. The president openly pressured Vice President Mike Pence to thwart the vote ratification — something not in Mr. Pence’s power to do.But I don’t think any of us expected to see radical, nearly all white protesters storming the Capitol as if it were the Bastille. I don’t think we expected to see Capitol Police basically ushering these terrorists into the building and letting them have the run of the place for a ridiculous amount of time while the world watched in shock and disgust. I don’t think we expected to see some of those police officers taking selfies with the intruders. I don’t think we expected that the violent protesters would be there by the explicit invitation of the president, who told a raucous gathering of his supporters to head over to the Capitol. “You have to show strength, and you have to be strong,” he said.On Wednesday, the world bore witness to white supremacy unchecked. I nearly choked on the bitter pill of what white people who no doubt condemned Black Lives Matter protesters as “thugs” felt so entitled to do.After the Capitol was cleared of protesters, Congress returned to work. Politicians peacocked and pontificated in condescending ways about the Constitution and flawed state voting procedures that, in fact, worked perfectly. Senator Ben Sasse smarmed about being neighborly and shoveling snow. He took a bizarre, jovial tone as if all the moment called for was a bit of charm. Senator Mitt Romney tried to take the role of elder statesman, expressing the level of outrage he should have shown over the past four years. It was all pageantry — too little, too late.Barack Obama famously spoke of a more perfect union. After this week, I don’t know that such an ambition is possible. I don’t know that it ever was. I don’t know that this union could or should be perfected.Politicians and pundits have promised that the guardrails of democracy will protect the Republic. They’ve said we need to trust in checks and balances and the peaceful transition of power that the United States claims is a hallmark of our country. And many of us have, however tentatively, allowed ourselves to believe that the laws this country was built on, however flawed, were strong enough to withstand authoritarian encroachments by President Trump and Republicans. What the days and weeks since the 2020 election have shown us is that the guardrails have been destroyed. Or maybe they were never there. Maybe they were never anything more than an illusion we created to believe this country was stronger than it was.As Americans began to process the Trump-endorsed insurrection, the blatant sedition, public figures shared the same platitudes about America that they always do when something in this country goes gravely wrong. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase; Joe Biden; Maria Shriver; Republican senators; and others declared that this is not America, that we are better than this, with “this” being the Capitol rampage, or Mr. Trump’s histrionics, or the politicians who, with a desperate thirst for power, allowed Mr. Trump’s lies about the election to flourish, unchallenged.This is America. This has always been America. If this were not America, this would not have happened. It’s time we face this ugly truth, let it sink into the marrow of our bones, let it move us to action.With everything that took place in Washington on Wednesday, it was easy to forget that Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock won their Senate races in Georgia. Their victories were gratifying and cathartic, the result of solid campaigns and the hard work of organizers on the ground in the state, from Stacey Abrams’s Fair Fight to Mijente and many others. Years of activism against the state’s dedication to voter suppression made these victories possible. The easy narrative will be that Black women and Black people saved this country. And they did. And they should be celebrated. But the more challenging narrative is that we now have to honor our salvation by doing something with it.For the first time in many years, Democrats will control the House, the Senate, and the presidency. Real change is not as elusive as it seemed before the Georgia runoffs because Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’s administration is well positioned to enact many of their policies. If the Democrats dare to use the power they have amassed, a brave new world might be possible.In the coming weeks, we’ll undoubtedly hear the argument that now is the time for centrism and compromise and bipartisan efforts. That argument is wrong. There is no compromise with politicians who amass power, hoard it, and refuse to relinquish it when the democratic process does not work in their favor. There is no compromise with politicians who create a set of conditions that allow such a violent incursion into the heart of government to take place, resulting in four deaths, countless injuries, and irreparable damage to the country both domestically and internationally. These people do not care about working with their colleagues on the other side of the proverbial aisle. They have an agenda, and whenever they are in power, they execute that agenda with precision and discipline. And they do so unapologetically.It’s time for Democrats to use their power in the same way and legislate without worrying about how Republican voters or politicians will respond. Cancel student loan debt. Pass another voting rights act that enfranchises as many Americans as possible. Create a true path to citizenship for undocumented Americans. Institute a $15 minimum hourly wage. Enact “Medicare for all.” Realistically, only so much is possible with a slender majority in the Senate, but the opportunity to make the most of the next two years is there.With the power they hold, Democrats can try to make this country a more equitable and generous place rather than one where the interests of the very wealthy and powerful are the priority. If they don’t, they are no better than their Republican counterparts, and in fact, they are worse because they will have squandered a real opportunity to do the work for which they were elected. Over the past four years, we have endured many battles for the soul of the country, but the war for the soul of this country rages on. I hope the Biden-Harris administration and the 117th Congress can end that war, once and for all.Roxane Gay (@rgay) is a contributing opinion writer.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

	<title>Con Biden vendrán más inmigrantes (y eso está bien)</title>
	<author>Jorge Ramos</author>
	<body>MIAMI, Estados Unidos — Donald Trump y el coronavirus redujeron la migración a Estados Unidos a los niveles más bajos en décadas.Con Joe Biden en la Casa Blanca, sin duda, vendrán nuevos inmigrantes. Y eso está bien. Estados Unidos tiene una oportunidad histórica de recuperar su imagen como un país de inmigrantes. Pero el arranque no será fácil.No sería ninguna sorpresa que con el fin de la racista y antiinmigrante era de Trump, Estados Unidos se vuelva a considerar un buen destino para personas que, considerando los desafíos que muchos enfrentan en casa, optan por migrar. Claro, los inmigrantes vienen a Estados Unidos desde diversos países, pero la mitad son latinoamericanos, así que aquí me enfocaré en ellos.La pandemia del coronavirus, de acuerdo con la Comisión Económica para América Latina y el Caribe de las Naciones Unidas, ha creado la peor crisis en América Latina en 120 años y ha generado una caída del producto interno bruto regional del 7,7 por ciento. Por esto, emigrar al norte es la única alternativa para muchas familias. Los efectos desastrosos de la COVID-19 se suman a la devastación causada en Centroamérica por los huracanes Eta e Iota y a los problemas de la violencia, desigualdad y hambre. Eso expulsa a cualquiera.Leonel Burgos, quien formó parte de una caravana que salió de Honduras rumbo a Estados Unidos en diciembre, le dijo a Univision que Biden ha hablado sobre “ayudar a todos los inmigrantes, vamos a ver si es cierto”. Esa caravana fue desmantelada por las autoridades hondureñas unos días después. “Lo que nosotros pedimos como inmigrantes es que el presidente que entró ahorita, por favor, nos ayude”, dijo Juan Fernando Benítez, otro de los integrantes de la caravana.Esto no es nuevo: cada vez que hay problemas en el sur, se reabre el tortuoso y peligroso camino al norte. El hambre es más fuerte que el miedo.Tras el fin de la pandemia y de los horrores de la era Trump, Estados Unidos también debe regresar a la normalidad y volver a su tradición histórica de recibir extranjeros. Nos ayudarán a salir de la actual crisis económica. Los inmigrantes hacen los trabajos más difíciles, crean empleos, pagan impuestos —se estima que los inmigrantes no autorizados pagan más de 11.000 millones de dólares en impuestos locales y estatales al año— y son una parte esencial de nuestra sociedad multiétnica y multicultural.Pero antes de enfrentar el desafío de las nuevas caravanas provenientes de Honduras, Guatemala y El Salvador, el gobierno de Biden tendrá que lidiar con las decenas de miles de solicitantes de asilo, en su mayoría centroamericanos, que ya esperan en México, junto a la frontera de Estados Unidos.En uno de los debates presidenciales, Biden criticó la política del presidente Trump que obliga a los solicitantes de asilo esperar en México. “Este es el primer presidente en la historia de Estados Unidos que hace que alguien que solicita asilo tenga que esperar en otro país”, dijo Biden. Ahora, ese será su problema. Si Biden quiere ser el reverso de Trump tendrá que ayudar a resolver la situación de estos refugiados con prontitud y con una actitud humanitaria. Han sido rechazados de todos lados y su última esperanza es Estados Unidos.El próximo gobierno ya ha enviado el mensaje de que será mucho más generosa con los inmigrantes, no solo con los que vienen sino también con los que ya están aquí. Hay una larga lista de promesas para los primeros cien días de gobierno, desde presentar una propuesta de ley para ofrecer vías a la ciudadanía a alrededor de 11 millones de personas indocumentadas y proteger a los dreamers hasta darle el estatus de protección temporal (TPS, por su sigla en inglés) a cientos de miles de venezolanos que viven en Estados Unidos que salieron de su país huyendo del régimen de Nicolás Maduro.Las propuestas migratorias de Biden contrastan radicalmente con las políticas impuestas por Trump. En una reciente entrevista con el medio conservador Washington Examiner, Ken Cuccinelli, el funcionario designado por Trump para liderar los Servicios de Inmigración y Ciudadanía (USCIS), calculó que hasta 140.000 inmigrantes podrían estar cruzando la frontera cada mes con Biden en la Casa Blanca. “Vimos el ‘efecto Trump’ cuando llegó a la presidencia”, dijo. “Y ahora van a ver el ‘efecto Biden’. Va a ser lo opuesto. […] Va a ser muy malo para Estados Unidos. Va a ser un problema humanitario, particularmente en medio de la COVID”.Las caravanas de migrantes centroamericanos y la situación de los solicitantes de asilo en los campos de refugiados en México podrían convertirse en la primera crisis internacional de Biden. El presidente electo tiene una estrategia de 4000 millones de dólares para mejorar las condiciones en Centroamérica y así evitar que las personas de la región que solían migrar a Estados Unidos no lo tengan que hacer. Y eso va a tomar años.Mientras no haya vacunas contra la COVID-19 para todos, es poco probable que el gobierno de Biden permita la entrada masiva de refugiados y de solicitantes de asilo. Es de esperar que estos primeros meses del año, mientras persista la escasez de vacunas, le den un colchón al nuevo gobierno para formular y ejecutar una política de inmigración que pueda abordar la crisis.Pero hay poco tiempo para maniobrar y las negociaciones en el Congreso no serán fáciles. Biden y su nominado para ser el próximo secretario del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional, Alejandro Mayorkas, un inmigrante nacido en Cuba, tendrán que vérselas simultáneamente con la urgencia de las caravanas y de los que apenas sobreviven en los campos de refugiados en México, junto a la esperanza de quienes llevan décadas esperando una regularización de su estatus migratorio dentro del país.El gobierno de Biden no debe ser de muros, jaulas, separaciones de familias, miedo y prohibiciones de entrada a ciudadanos de países predominantemente musulmanes, como fue el de Trump. Los buenos gobernantes no se definen por la manera en que tratan a los más ricos, sino por su trato hacia los más vulnerables. Y los inmigrantes son los más vulnerables.Sí, con Biden habrá más inmigrantes en Estados Unidos. Con Trump, el número de inmigrantes bajó a solo 595.000 en un año (de 2018 a 2019), la cifra más baja desde los años ochenta, según un análisis del Instituto Brookings. Y contrasta con los dos años inmediatamente anteriores a la llegada de Trump, cuando Estados Unidos autorizó la entrada de más de un millón de inmigrantes anualmente.Ese es el Estados Unidos que reconozco y admiro, el que yo escogí como país y que me permitió hacerme ciudadano, y que casi desapareció durante la presidencia de Trump. Lo que ahora más quiero es que los inmigrantes que llegaron después de mí tengan las mismas oportunidades y libertades que yo tuve.Jorge Ramos es periodista, conductor de los programas Noticiero Univisión y Al punto, y autor del libro Stranger: El desafío de un inmigrante latino en la era de Trump. @jorgeramosnews</body>

	<title>Democrats Threaten Impeachment if Pence Won’t Act After Capitol Siege</title>
	<author>Nicholas Fandos</author>
	<body>WASHINGTON — The top Democrats in Congress gave Vice President Mike Pence and the cabinet a jarring ultimatum on Thursday, threatening to undertake another impeachment if they did not invoke the 25th Amendment and strip President Trump of his powers after he incited a mob of his supporters that violently overtook the Capitol.On a day when lawmakers quite literally picked up the pieces of a Capitol vandalized in the president’s name as they met to formalize his election defeat, support was rapidly building among Democrats to take drastic action to punish Mr. Trump by any means possible, despite just 13 days remaining in his term. Though they raised practical concerns, even some members of the president’s party appeared newly open to the long-shot idea, which could bar Mr. Trump from ever again holding office.Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York made Mr. Pence their primary target, ratcheting up public pressure on him to use the 25th Amendment to wrest power from Mr. Trump for the remainder of his term. However, a person close to the vice president said Mr. Pence was opposed to invoking the process.By Mr. Schumer’s account, the two leaders waited on hold to speak with Mr. Pence about the matter for nearly half an hour Thursday morning, only to be told he would not come to the phone. Ms. Pelosi later indicated that they hoped for a public statement of his intentions, one way or another, within a day and would be prepared to move forward with impeachment if necessary.“This is urgent. This is an emergency of the highest magnitude,” she told reporters at the Capitol, calling Mr. Trump’s actions “seditious” and shaming members of the cabinet by name for not intervening. “While it’s only 13 days left, any day can be a horror show for America.”She said her phone was exploding with colleagues demanding, “Impeach, impeach, impeach.” It was a stark difference from her posture in 2019, when Ms. Pelosi resisted for months the idea of impeaching Mr. Trump, concerned that it would be a futile exercise that would divide her party.“I don’t care if you’re Democrat, Republican liberal, conservative, from the Northeast, South or West,” Mr. Schumer told reporters in New York. “If what happened yesterday doesn’t convince you that the president should be out of office now, then something is very wrong with your beliefs about democracy.”Democratic lawmakers and aides cautioned they were not yet ready to commit to pursuing the Constitution’s most extreme remedy. Just a year after charging the president with abuse of power and obstructing Congress for his attempts to pressure Ukraine’s leader to smear his political rival Joseph R. Biden Jr., House leaders are keenly aware of the logistical and political hurdles to doing so. No president has ever been impeached twice.They were also wary of rushing into a decision after an emotionally fraught 48 hours with little sleep. Ms. Pelosi sounded out members of her leadership team Thursday afternoon and scheduled a caucus conference call for Friday to discuss next steps.Under one school of thought being discussed among top House and Senate Democrats, the House could impeach Mr. Trump in the waning days of his term and the Senate could hold a trial immediately after President-elect Biden is sworn in and his party takes working control of the chamber.Modern presidential impeachments have been monthslong affairs. But under House rules, an impeachment resolution can be given privileged status, meaning it could be approved in only a couple of days’ time.Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, urged prompt action.“We have a limited period of time in which to act,” Mr. Nadler said. “The nation cannot afford a lengthy, drawn-out process, and I support bringing articles of impeachment directly to the House floor.”House lawyers were still researching whether a former president could be impeached or tried after leaving office. But precedent suggested the answer was yes. The House impeached President Ulysses S. Grant’s war secretary in 1876 for graft, even after he resigned from his post, and the Senate proactively determined that it still had authority to hold a trial. It did so, and the secretary was ultimately acquitted.Mr. Schumer, who is on track to become the Senate majority leader after Mr. Biden’s inauguration, was adamant it could be done.“We don’t need a lengthy debate,” he said. “The president’s abuse of power, his incitement of a mob against a duly elected representative body of the United States is a manifestly impeachable offense.”They conceded that conviction by the Senate, which would require a two-thirds majority, including 17 Republican defectors, remained a long shot. But some Democrats and Republicans privately reasoned that an impeachment had other benefits. If the Senate were to vote to convict, it could then proceed to bar Mr. Trump from ever holding federal office again, stamping out any prospect of him running in 2024, a possibility that some Republicans privately dread.Among those pushing leaders toward the idea were some of the House’s most outspoken progressives, including Representatives Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, and key moderates whose support for last year’s impeachment was crucial.Debating a criminal referral. The Jan. 6 House committee has grown divided over whether to make a criminal referral of former President Donald J. Trump to the Justice Department, even though it has concluded that it has enough evidence to do so. The debate centers on whether a referral would backfire by politically tainting the expanding federal investigation.Cooperating with investigators. Pat A. Cipollone and Patrick F. Philbi, two of Mr. Trump’s top White House lawyers, met with the Jan. 6 House committee, while Ali Alexander, a prominent organizer of pro-Trump events after the 2020 election, said he would assist in the federal investigation.Contempt charges. The House voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino Jr., two close allies of Mr. Trump, after the pair defied subpoenas from the special committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.“We must as a country demonstrate that this kind of behavior is beyond the pale,” Representative Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, a former national security official who represents a red district, said in a statement. “I’d prefer cabinet officials to take action, but will be ready to consider other steps, such as impeachment, in the short time we have left.”A group of Democrats on the judiciary panel, led by Representatives David Cicilline of Rhode Island and Jamie Raskin of Maryland, began circulating charges of “high crimes and misdemeanors.” They included a single count, “abuse of power,” based on Mr. Trump “willfully inciting violence against the government of the United States” in an effort to overturn the results of a democratically decided election. The articles also mention an explosive phone call by Mr. Trump pressuring Georgia’s secretary of state to “find” him the votes he needed to overturn Mr. Biden’s victory there.Other articles written by Ms. Omar had roughly 60 co-sponsors, she said.A handful of Republicans likewise sounded open to drastic action, though they discounted impeachment for practical reasons. Some Democrats similarly argued that it might not be worth the trouble of assembling and arguing a case with so little time left in office for Mr. Trump.Representative Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois, called on Mr. Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment, posting on Twitter that the president had become “unmoored not just from his duty or from his oath but from reality itself.”Representative Tom Reed, Republican of New York and co-chairman of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, argued that the impeachment process could backfire at a time when the nation appeared to be headed for a peaceful transfer of power after Mr. Pence and Congress ratified Mr. Biden’s victory.“You still have to remember there’s millions of Americans out there filled with this anger,” Mr. Reed said. “We did something last night. We completed the Democratic process when it was under attack by mob rule.”All but one Senate Republican voted to acquit Mr. Trump when he stood trial in the Senate last year, and it remained murky on Thursday how much sentiments may have changed.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the soon-to-be minority leader, spoke sternly on Wednesday about Mr. Trump’s unhinged campaign to overturn the election results, and many Republican senators were enraged by the violence he fanned. Privately, party aides speculated that a bloc of several senators could conceivably vote to convict the president if the right case was put before them.But doing so would thrust onto the party a complex political, constitutional and ethical calculation. In deciding whether to object on Wednesday to the Electoral College results, Republicans had to choose between obligations to the Constitution and the potential political costs of crossing Mr. Trump. A vote to convict him and potentially bar the most popular figure in their party from running again would be magnitudes more complicated.And there would almost certainly be intense opposition among Republicans who remain loyal to Mr. Trump. More than 120 of them in the House voted on Wednesday and early Thursday morning to overturn Mr. Biden’s victory in key swing states, arguing that the election had been stolen from Mr. Trump.Luke Broadwater contributed reporting.</body>

	<title>The Impractical but Indisputable Rise of Retrocomputing</title>
	<author>Kim Key</author>
	<body>For all the personal technology introduced and popularized in 2020 — upscale fitness bikes, at-home Covid tests, game consoles new and old — the personal computer lands on the list with a bit of a thud. PCs lack the novelty of other gadgets, but they’re practical, essential even, in a year when work, school and social life have come to rely heavily upon them.While modern, ever more efficient computers are selling better than they have in years, vintage computers — impractical old devices in need of repairs and out-of-production parts — are also in demand on sites like eBay. Collectors also flock to message boards, subreddits and Discord servers to buy, sell and trade parts.People are buying these PCs not necessarily for daily use, but for the satisfaction they get from rebuilding them. It’s a trend one might chalk up to quarantine boredom, though it’s been gaining traction for years.Retrocomputing, the hobby is called, is hardly just a way to pass the time. Instead, as enthusiasts see it, it’s a means of communing with the past.“You get into this mind-set of what it must’ve been like to be somebody in the late ’70s, having spent thousands of dollars on this thing that barely does anything more than a calculator,” said Clint Basinger, 34, who runs the YouTube channel Lazy Game Reviews. (The devices do allow retrocomputers to make art and music using software unavailable on new computers and to play 8-bit games, but not much else beyond that.)“It’s like a time machine to me,” Mr. Basinger added.Before the pandemic, there were several vintage computing conventions located around the United States, to which collectors brought their computers to show off. Attendees bought and traded hardware at these events, as well as meet the friends they’ve made online.Huxley Dunsany, 38, said about 100 people used to pass through the Local, a cafe in Alameda, Calif., on the last Wednesday of every month for the vintage computing meet-ups he hosted.“People were coming by walking by the cafe and doing big cartoon double takes when they saw all these old computers sitting in the window and coming in to ask what was going on,” he said.But for now, there’s the internet. Sites like the Vintage Computer Forum and 68kMLA have helped people bond over the hobby since the early aughts. One of the largest vintage computing subreddits, Retro Battlestations, has more than doubled in size over the last few years, from 23,000 subscribers in 2018 to more than 58,000 as of this month. There are also active Discord servers devoted to retrocomputing, as well as old-school bulletin-board systems for people to use with their out-of-date machines.Mr. Dunsany is passionate about bringing new people into the fold, especially those who lack a technical background or don’t fit the computer-nerd stereotype. “I would love to see more women in the hobby and more minorities getting involved because I’m a generic white guy in his late 30s,” he said. “I am sort of the default for this hobby, and I don’t want that to be true in 10 years.”Madeeha Al-Hussayni, a 37-year-old photographer from the United Kingdom, got into computers after watching her brothers use the family device growing up; in her teens, she started making music on her Amiga. These days, she posts YouTube videos about retrocomputing as MsMadLemon. She said there aren’t a lot of women in retrocomputing communities.“I was actually a little bit apprehensive getting into it, because it’s just me in a place where everyone’s male and it sort of was a little bit, ‘How am I going to be received?’” she said. “I’ve had people who are supportive and happy that I’m part of it. There’s a few people who have really been unhappy that I’m part of it. You know, half and half.”Cost can also intimidate. For computers that are contained systems like the Amiga, released in 1985, collectors can pay anywhere from $300 to $650 for a working device. Other PCs have separate parts, and scavenging for pieces can get expensive quickly.“It’s snowballed really, even in the last five years,” Mr. Basinger said. “I think some things are like 10 times as much as they were in 2015.”If a collector chooses to buy all of the parts online, putting together a working Intel Pentium III 1133 from 1999 would cost about $500. A mid ’90s monitor alone can range from $135 to more than $2,000 on eBay, and that’s before shipping. The older the computer, the harder it is to find working parts and peripherals, so computers and parts from the late ’70s and ’80s can also cost hundreds of dollars online.The most sought-after devices go for much steeper prices. An Apple-1, the tech behemoth’s Steve Wozniak creation, sold for nearly half a million dollars at auction back in 2019.Amir Husain, the 43-year-old founder of the A.I. company SparkCognition, owns 150 vintage computers. He values both the technology’s connection with the past and its rarity when seeking items for his collection.“I bought a Silicon Graphics Indigo at auction, which was used by Steven Spielberg when he created ‘Jurassic Park,’” he said. “On the front cover it says ‘The Steven Spielberg edition, 1 of 1,’ and on the inside, there are two business cards from S.G.I. executives with personal notes to Steven Spielberg.”Ryan Horan, 22, has just three reasonably priced vintage computers in his collection: two Atari STs and one Commodore 64. He sees retrocomputing as a glimpse into a world he has never experienced.“I was born at the tail end of the ’90s,” Mr. Horan said. “I just heard stories of things from my grandparents back in the ’50s and my parents back in the ’80s. So I’ve never been able to experience what those things were apart from stories and having physical things that were from that time that are still perfectly functional.”Consider this next time you think about tossing a supposedly obsolete iPhone.</body>

	<title>More Immigrants Will Come to the U.S. Under President Biden. That’s a Good Thing.</title>
	<author>Jorge Ramos</author>
	<body>MIAMI — The restrictive policies of the Trump administration, combined with the coronavirus pandemic, have reduced migration to the United States to its lowest level in decades.However, there’s little doubt that more immigrants will start coming once Joe Biden becomes president. And that’s OK. The United States has a historic opportunity to regain its image as a country of immigrants. But it won’t be easy.It’s no surprise that the end of the racist, anti-immigrant Trump administration would once again make the United States an attractive destination for migrants, particularly considering the challenges many face at home. Of course, immigrants come to the United States from many countries, but half of them are Latin Americans, so that’s whom I’m focusing on.The Covid-19 pandemic has created the worst economic crisis in Latin America in 120 years — with a 7.7 percent drop in regional gross domestic product, according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. Emigrating to the north is the only alternative for many families. The disastrous effects of the pandemic have exacerbated the devastation caused in Central America by Hurricanes Eta and Iota in November, just as it has worsened the violence, inequality and hunger that plague the region. All this would make anyone want to flee.Leonel Burgos, part of a caravan in Honduras that left for the United States in December, told Univision that Mr. Biden “said he was going to help all immigrants; let’s see if it’s true.” The caravan was dismantled by the Honduran authorities a few days later. “As immigrants, what we ask the president who just won is that he help us — please,” said Juan Fernando Benítez, another member of the caravan.None of this is new: Whenever there are problems in the south, the dangerous road to the north becomes more enticing. Hunger is stronger than fear.After the pandemic and the horrors of the Trump era, the United States must return to its historic tradition of receiving foreigners. Doing so will help the country emerge from its economic crisis. Immigrants work the toughest jobs, create employment opportunities for others and give back to their communities. Undocumented immigrants contribute more than $11 billion a year in state and local taxes. Immigrants are an essential part of our multiethnic, multicultural society.But before the Biden administration can address the challenge of new migrant caravans heading north, it will have to deal with the tens of thousands of asylum seekers, mostly Central Americans, already stranded in Mexico along the U.S. border.In one of last year’s presidential debates, Mr. Biden criticized the Trump policy that requires those seeking asylum to wait in Mexico while their claims are processed. “This is the first president in the history of the United States of America that anybody seeking asylum has to do it in another country,” Mr. Biden said. Now those refugees will be his problem. If he wants to be the anti-Trump president, Mr. Biden will have to resolve this situation promptly and humanely.The incoming administration has already sent the message that it will be much more welcoming to immigrants — and not only those seeking to enter the United States, but also those who are already here. The administration has a long list of promises to fulfill in its first 100 days, from legalizing America’s approximately 11 million undocumented immigrants and protecting Dreamers to granting temporary protected status to the hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans living in the United States who escaped Nicolás Maduro’s regime.Mr. Biden’s immigration proposals stand in stark contrast to policies imposed by President Trump. In a recent interview with the Washington Examiner, a conservative outlet, Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary of homeland security, estimated that up to 140,000 immigrants could cross the border each month under Mr. Biden. “I mean, you saw the ‘Trump effect’ when President Trump came into office,” Mr. Cuccinelli said. “You’re going to see the ‘Biden effect’ as well. And it’s going to be the opposite. And they’re feeding that, and it’s really bad for America. It’s going to be a humanitarian problem, particularly in the midst of Covid.”The Central American migrant caravans and the situation in Mexico’s refugee camps could become the Biden administration’s first major international crises. The president-elect has a $4 billion investment plan to create jobs in Central America and prevent more people from migrating to the United States to look for work — though this plan isn’t going to have an effect in the region anytime soon.As long as there aren’t enough Covid-19 vaccines for everyone, it’s unlikely the Biden administration will allow a massive influx of refugees and asylum seekers into the country. These months of vaccine scarcity will hopefully provide the administration the time it needs to formulate and execute a new immigration policy that can address the crisis.But there is little time to maneuver, and congressional negotiations won’t be easy. Mr. Biden and his nominee for secretary of homeland security, Alejandro Mayorkas — a Cuban-born immigrant — will have to deal simultaneously with the urgency of the caravans and those barely surviving in Mexico’s camps. They’ll also have to deal with the unauthorized immigrants who have been in the United States for decades, waiting for their status to be regularized.Mr. Biden shouldn’t build walls or separate immigrant families or bar migrants from Muslim-majority countries, as Mr. Trump has. Good leaders are defined by how they treat the most vulnerable in their charge, not the wealthiest or most powerful. And immigrants are, by far, the most vulnerable.Yes, there will be more immigrants in the United States with Mr. Biden in the White House. Under Mr. Trump, annual net immigration fell to just 595,000 people, the fewest since the 1980s, according to the Brookings Institution. In the two years immediately preceding the Trump presidency, the United States saw net immigration of more than one million people annually.That’s the United States I recognize and admire, the one that allowed me to become a citizen — and the one that almost disappeared during the Trump administration. Now what I want above all else is for the immigrants who come after me to have the same opportunities and freedoms I’ve had.Jorge Ramos (@jorgeramosnews) is an anchor for the Univision network, a contributing opinion writer and the author of, most recently, “Stranger: The Challenge of a Latino Immigrant in the Trump Era.”The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

	<title>To Create a Healthy Habit, Find an Accountability Buddy</title>
	<author>Tara Parker-Pope</author>
	<body>If you want to make positive changes in your life, try building on a lesson many of us learned in 2020: Hold yourself accountable.The notion of accountability — to yourself and to others — has been an important part of pandemic living. To avoid spreading the virus, we’ve needed to be accountable for wearing a mask, limiting our contacts and keeping our distance.But accountability can also help you achieve your health goals. Gretchen Rubin, author of “Better Than Before,” a book about forming healthy habits, says that accountability is an important tool for making and breaking habits.Accountability works best when it comes from the outside. You can create accountability by checking in with a friend every day to talk about healthful eating. You’re more likely to exercise if you’ve made a plan to walk with a friend or scheduled a workout with a personal trainer. You can create public accountability by declaring your intention on social media.If you prefer to stay accountable only to yourself, you can create accountability by using an app that sends you daily reminders or by wearing a Fitbit or smart watch to track your exercise habits. You can even hold yourself accountable through a daily journal entry.“We do better when someone’s watching,” Ms. Rubin said. “Even when we’re the ones doing the watching!”A 2018 North Carolina State University study of 704 people enrolled in a 15-week online weight-loss program found that participants with buddies lost more weight and waist inches than those who took the course without buddy support.So for today’s Well challenge, think about a health goal you want to achieve and focus on how you can hold yourself accountable. I’ve included a few suggestions for how to do it. Sign up for the Well newsletter to get the 7-Day Well Challenge in your inbox.Day 6What is your goal for 2021? Do you want to improve your eating habits, lose weight or exercise more? Or maybe you just want to finish that screenplay you’ve been working on? You’re more likely to succeed if you get some help.Find an accountability buddy. Choose a friend who wants to achieve a similar goal and make a plan. Accountability might mean meeting each other once or twice a week for a walking date. Or it could be a daily text check-in to see how you’re doing on a diet or a Zoom call to work on a decluttering project together.“Some people are very accountable to themselves, but not most people,” said Dr. Tim Church, a well-known exercise and obesity expert and chief medical officer for Naturally Slim, an app-based behavioral health program in Dallas. “In my years of working with thousands of people, there’s one thing that drives accountability more than anything else: If you want to keep people doing a behavior, get a buddy.”While the presence of an accountability buddy adds some gentle peer pressure, the key is to focus on the behavior, not success or failure. For instance, if a person is trying to lose weight, don’t focus on the scale. Instead, check in and remind them to log what they ate, encourage them to eat more fruits and vegetables and remind them of the benefits of a regular weigh-in (but you don’t need to ask them the result). If they’re beating themselves up for eating two desserts, talk about what might have triggered an emotional eating binge.“An accountability partner is there to support you, to problem-solve and to celebrate even the small victories,” Dr. Church said. “Judgment is the quickest way to destroy all that. People are so hard on themselves. You don’t need to be hard on them.”Use an app. An app is a great way to add accountability to your day. Meditation apps like Headspace and Calm will send daily reminders and track your progress. The weight-loss app Noom asks you to check in for a few minutes each day, complete mini-health courses and track what you’ve eaten. The Fitbit app counts your steps, will sync with your smart scale and vibrates to remind you to get up and move.Set reminders. Once you set a health goal, hold yourself accountable by creating calendar reminders to help you achieve it. Schedule walk breaks or daily or weekly check-ins with your accountability buddy.Declare it on social media. Telling your friends on social media that you’re cutting back on packaged foods, or sending a tweet every time you finish a class on your exercise bike creates virtual accountability. Commit to posting on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or another platform every time you complete a goal, or share your feelings on days you’re struggling. When you declare your goals on social media, you’re likely to find a like-minded friend who will want to join your journey and offer words of support.</body>

	<title>Capitol Police Officer Dies From Injuries in Pro-Trump Rampage</title>
	<author>Mike Baker</author>
	<body>Update Feb. 12, 2021: New information has emerged regarding the death of the Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick that questions the initial cause of his death provided by officials close to the Capitol Police.A United States Capitol Police officer died on Thursday night from injuries sustained “while physically engaging” with pro-Trump rioters who descended on the U.S. Capitol the day before, the fifth fatality linked to the chaos that engulfed the nation’s capital on Wednesday, according to the authorities.The officer, Brian D. Sicknick, was only the fourth member of the force to be killed in the line of duty since its founding two centuries ago. After the bedlam of Wednesday’s siege and the recriminations that filled the airwaves the next day, a silence descended over the Capitol grounds late Thursday as hundreds of law enforcement officers from scores of agencies lined the streets to pay tribute to their fallen comrade.But the loss of life also underscored the failure of law enforcement agencies to prevent the siege of the Capitol. And with leaders of both political parties calling for investigations, it appeared likely to lead to calls for profound changes to the Capitol Police.The circumstances surrounding Mr. Sicknick's death were not immediately clear, and the Capitol Police said only that he had “passed away due to injuries sustained while on duty.” Law enforcement officials initially said Mr. Sicknick was struck with a fire extinguisher, but weeks later, police sources and investigators were at odds over whether he was hit. Medical experts have said he did not die of blunt force trauma, according to one law enforcement official.“He returned to his division office and collapsed,” the Capitol Police said in the statement. “He was taken to a local hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries.”Mr. Sicknick, who joined the force in 2008, died at about 9:30 p.m. on Thursday, the Capitol Police said in a statement. The Washington police department’s homicide branch is one of several law enforcement agencies involved in an investigation into his death and the overall circumstances of the violence at the Capitol.The officer’s death brings the fatalities from Wednesday’s mayhem to five. One participant in the pro-Trump rampage, Ashli Babbitt, was fatally shot by a Capitol Police officer inside the building as she climbed through a broken window leading to the Speaker’s Lobby. Three other people died after experiencing what were believed to be medical emergencies in the area around the Capitol, the police said.It was unclear where Mr. Sicknick’s encounter with the rioters took place, but photos and a video posted by a local reporter during the night of chaos showed a man spraying a fire extinguisher outside the Senate chamber, with a small number of police officers overlooking the area on a nearby stairway.Lawmakers in both chambers and from both parties vowed to find out how those responsible for Capitol security had allowed a violent mob to infiltrate the building. House Democrats announced a “robust” investigation into the law enforcement breakdown.Three of Congress’s top security officials — Capitol Police Chief Steven A. Sund, House Sergeant at Arms Paul D. Irving and Senate Sergeant at Arms Michael C. Stenger — announced their resignations on Thursday.The sergeants-at-arms are responsible for security in the chambers and related office buildings, while Mr. Sund oversaw roughly 2,000 Capitol Police personnel — a force larger than that of many small cities.Early Friday, Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio, a Democrat who runs the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the Capitol Police’s budget, expressed sorrow in a Twitter post over Mr. Sicknick’s death.“This tragic loss is a reminder of the bravery of the law enforcement who protect us every day,” Mr. Ryan wrote.Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat who is chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, which opened a review into the law enforcement response to the Capitol riot, said her “heart breaks over the senseless death.”“To honor his memory, we must ensure that the mob who attacked the People’s House and those who instigated them are held accountable,” she said on Twitter.Hundreds of police officers and emergency response personnel lined the streets by the Capitol for a moment of silence to honor Mr. Sicknick on Thursday night. They stood in lines on Constitution Avenue and 3rd Street, saluting in silence as a police motorcade for Mr. Sicknick passed through the city, according to videos from local reporters at the scene.The police force said in its own statement that “the entire U.S.C.P. department expresses its deepest sympathies to Officer Sicknick’s family and friends on their loss, and mourns the loss of a friend and colleague.”Officials have said that about 50 police officers were injured as the mob swarmed barricades, threw objects, battered doors, smashed windows and overwhelmed some of the officers who tried to resist the advancing crowd.Debating a criminal referral. The Jan. 6 House committee has grown divided over whether to make a criminal referral of former President Donald J. Trump to the Justice Department, even though it has concluded that it has enough evidence to do so. The debate centers on whether a referral would backfire by politically tainting the expanding federal investigation.Cooperating with investigators. Pat A. Cipollone and Patrick F. Philbi, two of Mr. Trump’s top White House lawyers, met with the Jan. 6 House committee, while Ali Alexander, a prominent organizer of pro-Trump events after the 2020 election, said he would assist in the federal investigation.Contempt charges. The House voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino Jr., two close allies of Mr. Trump, after the pair defied subpoenas from the special committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.The Capitol Police reported 14 arrests during the incursion, including two people accused of assaulting a police officer. The local police arrested dozens of others, mostly in connection with unlawful entry and violations of the city’s Wednesday night curfew.The Capitol Police force is charged solely with protecting the Capitol and surrounding grounds. Over the course of two centuries, the force has evolved, its mission shifting and growing with the nature of the threats to the institution.An event that had one of the most profound impacts on the force played out on March 1, 1954, when Puerto Rican nationalists opened fire from the visitor’s gallery on lawmakers below, wounding five. Shortly afterward, the police were issued weapons for the first time.Exactly 17 years later, on March 1, 1971, an explosion ripped through a ground-floor restroom in the Senate wing. The Weather Underground, a militant left-wing group that carried out a series of bombings in the late 1960s and 1970s, took responsibility. The incident led to the requirement of checking all visitors for weapons and explosives.The first recorded death of a member of the force was in 1984, when Sgt. Christopher Eney, 37, was killed during a training exercise.The last time a Capitol Police officer was killed in the line of duty was in the summer of 1998, when Officer Jacob J. Chestnut and Detective John Gibson were fatally shot by Russell Eugene Weston Jr., a man tormented by visions of an oppressive federal government.Mr. Weston, who was shot and injured in the incident, blasted his way into the nation’s centerpiece of law and order. It all played out in a matter of minutes, reaching its bloody conclusion when he reached the majority whip’s ground-floor office complex.A fourth person, Angela Dickerson, 24, a tourist, was injured but recovered.President Bill Clinton called the gunfight just inside the East Front entrance to the nation’s lawmaking forum “a moment of savagery at the front door of American civilization.”Lawmakers from both parties said at the time that they hoped the bloodshed would allow for a moment reflection, when partisan divisions could start to be healed.Two decades later, the fourth Capitol Police officer in history was killed.Emily Cochrane and Katie Benner contributed reporting.</body>

	<title>‘Mean Girls’ Won’t Return to Broadway</title>
	<author>Michael Paulson</author>
	<body>The coronavirus pandemic has felled another Broadway show: “Mean Girls.”The musical’s producers, led by Lorne Michaels of “Saturday Night Live,” announced on Thursday that they would not seek to reopen in New York once the pandemic eases. However, the producers do plan to restart the show’s national tour.The show is the fourth Broadway closing prompted by the pandemic: Disney announced last spring that it would not reopen “Frozen,” and the producers of two plays that had been in previews, Martin McDonagh’s “Hangmen” and a revival of Edward Albee’s “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,” decided not to wait out the shutdown at all.The “Mean Girls” closing was prompted by the costs of keeping the production intact while theaters are dark. Broadway has been closed since last March, and it seems likely that most shows will not return until the fall or later.The musical, adapted from a 2004 film, features a book by Tina Fey; music by Jeff Richmond, who is married to Fey; lyrics by Nell Benjamin; and direction by Casey Nicholaw.It opened in 2018 and was a hit, recouping its $17 million capitalization costs and grossing $124 million over 834 performances, according to the production. But it won none of the 12 Tony Awards for which it was nominated, and its weekly box office had softened over time.The “Mean Girls” national tour began in Buffalo in 2019, and a London production, which was in the works before the pandemic, is still planned, according to Michaels. Paramount Pictures announced last January that it would make a film version of the stage musical, produced by Michaels and Fey.</body>

	<title>Wall Street Journal editorial board urges Trump to resign to avoid second impeachment.</title>
	<author>Michael M. Grynbaum</author>
	<body>The editorial board of The Wall Street Journal, the American flagship of Rupert Murdoch’s newspaper empire, denounced President Trump on Thursday for inciting a mob of his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol, declaring his behavior “impeachable” and encouraging Mr. Trump to resign his office to prevent a second impeachment by the Democratic-controlled House.In an unsigned article titled “Donald Trump’s Final Days,” the Journal’s editorial page — a bellwether for the conservative establishment — excoriated the president for “an assault on the constitutional process of transferring power after an election” and said “this week has probably finished him as a serious political figure.”“If Mr. Trump wants to avoid a second impeachment, his best path would be to take personal responsibility and resign,” the Journal wrote, concluding, “It is best for everyone, himself included, if he goes away quietly.”The Journal’s editorial page, led by the editor Paul Gigot, has criticized Mr. Trump in the past, sometimes harshly. But its latest salvo was a striking repudiation of the president by a news outlet controlled by Mr. Murdoch, whose Fox News cable network is home to several of Mr. Trump’s most loyal and longstanding media defenders.Mr. Murdoch’s publicists had previously indicated that he did not expect Mr. Trump to recapture the presidency, and another Murdoch publication, The New York Post, trumpeted President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory even as Mr. Trump refused to accept the results.The Post, in its own unsigned editorial on Thursday, stopped short of arguing that Mr. Trump should prematurely exit the White House, instead urging his aides “to stay and stop the crazy.” But given Mr. Murdoch’s influence on his publications’ political views, the Journal’s blunt words for Mr. Trump — who once craved Mr. Murdoch’s approval — signal that the mogul is now looking ahead to the start of the Biden presidency.</body>

	<title>Trump siempre ha sido un lobo disfrazado de lobo</title>
	<author>Ezra Klein</author>
	<body>Durante años, ha existido un mantra que los republicanos recitan para consolarse acerca del presidente Trump, tanto por las cosas que dice como por el apoyo que le ofrecen. Según ellos, Trump debe ser tomado en serio, pero no literalmente. La frase proviene de un artículo de Salena Zito publicado en The Atlantic, en 2016, en el que se quejaba de que la prensa se tomaba a Trump “literalmente, pero no en serio; sus seguidores lo toman en serio, pero no literalmente”.Para las élites republicanas, se trató de un argumento muy útil. Si las palabras de Trump se entendían como una serie de capas de exageración y estilo folklórico, diseñadas para provocar a los pedantes de los medios de comunicación pero perfectamente comprensibles para sus partidarios comunes y corrientes, entonces, mucho de lo que sería demasiado grotesco o falso como para poder ser aceptado de manera literal podría respaldarse cuidadosamente, en el mejor de los casos, o simplemente ignorarse como un mal chiste en las peores ocasiones. Y las élites republicanas podían caminar por la cuerda floja entre acabar con su reputación o enfurecer al líder de su partido, mientras culpaban a los medios de comunicación por caricaturizar al trumpismo al reportar con precisión las palabras de Trump.El 5 de noviembre de 2020, pocos días después de las elecciones, el vicepresidente Mike Pence protagonizó un ejemplo perfecto de esa actitud. Cuando Trump declaró que las elecciones fueron robadas, en términos tan contundentes como un puñetazo en la cara, Pence trató de tomarlo en serio, pero no de manera literal; así que fue solidario con la furia de Trump mientras se alejaba de sus afirmaciones reales. “Estoy con el presidente @RealDonaldTrump”, tuiteó. “Debemos contar cada voto LEGAL”.Pero Trump no quería que se contaran todos los votos legales. Quería que se eliminaran los votos contados legalmente y que se consiguieran nuevos sufragios a su favor. Quería ganar, no perder; costara lo que costara, cualesquiera que sean los medios. Y, desde entonces, aumentó la presión todos los días, lo que originó la extraña teoría esgrimida por los trumpistas en las últimas semanas de que el vicepresidente estaba autorizado para aceptar o rechazar los resultados de las elecciones del 6 de enero; es decir, que Pence podría, por sí solo, corregir ese error. Y así, después de años de servicio leal, de degradaciones diarias y humillaciones constantes, Trump también atacó a Pence, declarándolo como un enemigo más del pueblo.“Mike Pence no tuvo el coraje de hacer lo que debía para proteger nuestro país y nuestra Constitución”, se enfureció Trump, acabando con cualquier relación que Pence haya construido con su base.El miércoles, en el Capitolio, los que se tomaron a Trump en serio y los que se lo tomaron literalmente chocaron de manera espectacular. Dentro del edificio, un grupo de senadores republicanos, liderados por Ted Cruz y Josh Hawley, formulaban un desafío irresponsable a los resultados del Colegio Electoral. No tenían ninguna oportunidad de anular los resultados y lo sabían. No tenían pruebas de que los resultados debían anularse y lo sabían. Y no actuaron, ni hablaron, como si realmente creyeran que la elección había sido robada. Estaban allí para tomar en serio las preocupaciones de Trump, no literalmente sino con la esperanza de que los seguidores del mandatario pudieran convertirse en sus seguidores en 2024.Pero, al mismo tiempo, Trump les estaba diciendo a sus seguidores que le robaron las elecciones y que ellos tenían que resistir. Y lo tomaron literalmente. No experimentaron eso como la actuación de un agravio; lo vieron como un asalto profundo. Irrumpieron en el Capitolio, atacaron a oficiales de policía, destrozaron puertas, barreras y saquearon las oficinas del Congreso. En medio del caos, una mujer recibió un disparo y falleció.Si sus acciones te parecen una locura, imagínatelo desde su perspectiva, desde dentro de la estructura epistémica en la que viven. El presidente de Estados Unidos les dijo que las elecciones habían sido robadas por el Partido Demócrata, que les estaban negando el poder y la representación que legítimamente habían ganado. “Conozco tu dolor”, dijo Trump en su video del miércoles, desde el jardín de la Casa Blanca. “Conozco tu dolor. Nos robaron una elección. Fue una elección arrolladora y todos lo saben”. Más de una docena de senadores republicanos, más de 100 miembros republicanos de la Cámara de Representantes e innumerables figuras de los medios conservadores respaldaron las afirmaciones de Trump.Si quienes se consideran revolucionarios no obedecieron la ley, fue porque sus líderes les dijeron que la ley había sido violada, y de la manera más profunda e irreversible. Si su respuesta fue extrema, también lo fue el delito. Si las victorias aplastantes pueden caer en las artimañas de los demócratas, entonces la política se derrumba en un sinsentido. ¿Cómo se les podía permitir a los ladrones escapar con el control total del gobierno federal como premio? La mayoría de los republicanos cree que las elecciones fueron robadas y la mayoría respalda la insurrección como respuesta. Una encuesta rápida de YouGov reveló que el 45 por ciento de los republicanos aprobaron el asalto al Capitolio; el 43 por ciento se opuso.La gran virtud de Trump, como figura pública, es su literalidad. Sus declaraciones pueden estar plagadas de mentiras, pero es honesto acerca de quién es y qué pretende. Cuando perdió el caucus de Iowa ante Cruz en 2016, declaró que “Ted Cruz no ganó Iowa, la robó”. Cuando parecía probable que perdería las elecciones presidenciales ante Hillary Clinton, comenzó a calificar la elección como amañada. Cuando quiso que el presidente de Ucrania abriera una investigación por corrupción sobre Joe Biden, hizo la demanda directamente, en una llamada grabada. Cuando se le preguntó, durante los debates presidenciales de 2020, si se comprometería a una transferencia pacífica del poder en caso de una derrota, se negó. No hubo subterfugios por parte de Trump para los terribles eventos del 6 de enero. Invocó esta oportunidad, una y otra vez, hasta que sucedió.El Partido Republicano que ha ayudado e instigado a Trump es igual de despreciable, o más, porque inundan la prensa con citas asegurando que saben algo más. En una frase que llegará a definir esta era sórdida (y a ese partido sórdido), un republicano de alto rango le dijo a The Washington Post: “¿Cuál es la desventaja de complacerlo durante este breve período de tiempo? Nadie piensa seriamente que los resultados cambiarán”. Lo que sucedió el miércoles en Washington es el lado negativo. Millones de estadounidenses lo tomaron literalmente. No sabrán que estás “complaciendo” al hombre más poderoso del mundo. Se sentirán traicionados y desesperados. Y algunos de ellos estarán armados.A menudo, la era Trump ha estado envuelta en un manto de ironía autoprotectora. Se nos ha pedido que separemos al hombre de sus tuits, que creamos que Trump no quiere decir lo que dice, que no tiene la intención de actuar según sus convicciones, que no es lo que obviamente es. Cualquier divergencia entre la palabra y la realidad se ha incluido en ese principio. El hecho de que Trump no haya logrado mucho de lo que prometió debido a su incompetencia y distracción ha sido reformulado como una señal de una situación más delicada. Las limitaciones impuestas sobre él por otras instituciones o actores burocráticos se han reformulado como evidencia de que nunca tuvo la intención de seguir adelante con sus declaraciones más salvajes. Esa fue una ficción conveniente para el Partido Republicano, pero fue una fantasía desastrosa para el país. Y ahora se ha derrumbado.Cuando los literalistas se apresuraron a entrar en la cámara, Pence, Cruz y Hawley estaban entre los que tuvieron que ser evacuados, por su propia seguridad. Algunos de sus compatriotas, como la senadora Kelly Loeffler, rescindieron sus objeciones a la elección, aparentemente conmovidos por la bestia que habían creado. Pero no hay un refugio real del movimiento que alimentaron. Las legiones de Trump todavía están ahí afuera, y ahora están de luto por una muerte y se sienten aún más engañados por muchos de sus supuestos aliados en Washington, quienes se volvieron contra ellos tan pronto como hicieron lo que pensaron que se les había pedido.El problema no son los que tomaron en serio la palabra de Trump desde el principio. Son los muchos, muchos republicanos electos que no lo tomaron en serio, ni literalmente, sino con cinismo. Ellos han desencadenado esto sobre sus cabezas, y sobre las nuestras.Ezra Klein se unió a la la sección de Opinión en 2021.

	<title>Protesters in New York Urge Ouster of Trump and Pence</title>
	<author>Sean Piccoli</author>
	<body>A crowd of several thousand anti-Trump protesters gathered at Barclays Center in Brooklyn on Thursday evening, and then filled Flatbush Avenue for a peaceful march to the Prospect Park West home of Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York.As the group made its way to Mr. Schumer’s building, demonstrators chanted “No Trump, no K.K.K., no fascist U.S.A.,” accompanied by the rhythms of drummers and percussionists.Several people in the crowd said that they had been moved to venture into the chilly night after watching Mr. Trump’s supporters storm the United States Capitol building on Wednesday in Washington.“What we saw was incredibly frustrating and tragic, and a lot of people are looking for direction,” said Nina Svirsky, a teacher from Brooklyn.Dozens of masked, uniformed police officers monitored the rally; no arrests were reported. After most of the crowd had melted away, the talk among some of those left turned specifically to the stark racial disparities in crowd control and enforcement that were on display Wednesday.“If it was us, we really would have got beat up, so we’re upset at that,” said Alfred Martinez, 39, a Black man who said he had come from the Bronx.In Manhattan, a much smaller group gathered in Times Square, where members of Refuse Fascism, an activist organization, unfurled a banner with the hashtag “#OutNow!” and called for the removal from office of President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.“We are out here today because what we saw yesterday was an attempted coup,” one of the protest’s organizers, Jennifer Sabel, said through a loudspeaker.Noting the crowd’s modest size, Ms. Sabel urged those who were there to return on Saturday and to bring others with them for what she said she hoped would be a national day of protest. The demonstration ended after about an hour.Emma Kaplan, another Refuse Fascism organizer, said that she and her compatriots did not feel as though they could just bide their time until President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. succeeds Mr. Trump later this month.“The next 13 days, what we do now, is going to determine the future,” Ms. Kaplan said. “We have to be out and not hope that this is going to resolve itself because yesterday actually showed where that leads.”</body>

	<title>The Sperm Kings Have a Problem: Too Much Demand</title>
	<author>Nellie Bowles</author>
	<body>To hear more audio stories from publishers like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android.The sperm kings of America are exhausted.These men are flying all over the place. They are shipping their sperm with new vial systems and taking the latest DNA tests because that is what women want now. Sure, they can talk on the phone, but they say it has to be quick because they are driving to Dallas or Kansas City or Portland, Maine, in time for an ovulation window. They would like to remind me they have day jobs.“People are fed up with sperm banks,” said Kyle Gordy, 29, who lives in Malibu, Calif. He invests in real estate but spends most of his time donating his sperm, free (except for the cost of travel), to women. He also runs a nearly 11,000-member private Facebook group, Sperm Donation USA, which helps women connect with a roster of hundreds of approved donors. His donor sperm has sired 35 children, with five more on the way, he said.“They realize this isn’t some taboo anymore,” Mr. Gordy said.If you are one of the roughly 141 million Americans whose body produces sperm, the substance likely seems abundant and cheap. For the rest of us, it is very much neither.That has always been true, especially if one is discerning. But now, the coronavirus pandemic is creating a shortage, sperm banks and fertility clinics said. Men have stopped going in as much to donate, even as demand has stayed steady at some banks and increased rapidly at others.“We’ve been breaking records for sales since June worldwide not just in the U.S. — we’ve broken our records for England, Australia and Canada,” said Angelo Allard, the compliance supervisor of Seattle Sperm Bank, one of the country’s biggest sperm banks. He said his company was selling 20 percent more sperm now than a year earlier, even as supplies dwindled.“Between our three locations, I’ll usually have 180 unique donors donating,” Mr. Allard said. “I’m down to 117. The other month it was 80. I don’t have any indication it’s going to be a positive trend.”Michelle Ottey, director of operations at Fairfax Cryobank, another large sperm bank, said demand was up for access to its catalog for online sperm shopping because “people are seeing that there is the possibility of more flexibility in their lives and work.”“I also think part of it is people are trying to find some hope right now,” she added.The scarcity has people on edge. Many are annoyed.“Will there by any new donors soon?” someone with the handle BabyV2021 recently wrote on the online forum for California Cryobank, one of the world’s biggest sperm banks. “It seems like the donor supply has been dwindling,” wrote another, who had the handle sc_cal.And so in the capitalist crunch, Sperm World — the world of people buying and selling sperm — has gotten wild. Donors are going direct to customers. They meet with prospective mothers-to-be in Airbnbs for an afternoon handoff; Facebook groups with tens of thousands of members have sprung up.The reason I know this at all is simple enough: I am 32 years old, partnered to a woman, stuck at home and in the market for the finest sperm I can get.When I started talking to sperm banks last spring, they were already concerned about supply.Reliable numbers are tough to find in Sperm World.  Researchers cite data collected in the 1980s to estimate the number of children born by donor sperm in the United States at anywhere from 30,000 to 60,000 a year, though advocates push back even on that range, saying there are no dependable figures because there is no regulation. Sperm banking itself was about a $4 billion industry in 2018.There have always been infertile straight couples in need of donor sperm, but with the legalization of gay marriage and the rise of elective single motherhood, the market has expanded over the last decade. About 20 percent of sperm bank clients are heterosexual couples, 60 percent are gay women, and 20 percent are single moms by choice, the banks said.To meet this demand, men provided sperm at a steady rate for years, some banks said. But the coronavirus changed things. Existing donors were scared to go in. New donor sign-ups stopped for months during lockdown and never really bounced back at some banks. Several banks said that they had a lot of old frozen sperm in storage, but that it could last only so long.“Donor recruiting is a growing challenge,” said Scott Brown, vice president of strategic alliances for California Cryobank. “And I would definitely say people are still very interested in having children.”Many people also want smart sperm. That’s why some big banks are near elite colleges. They have sperm collection centers in Palo Alto, Calif., near Stanford University, and Cambridge, Mass., near Harvard. College men are one of the most reliable groups to see the potential chaos of creating maybe 50 biological children around the world in exchange for about $4,000 over several months — and decide it is a good deal.A donor would usually go to a bank once or twice a week over months to produce enough sperm to sell to dozens of families. “A lot of their recruiting goes on around fraternities, but fraternities aren’t getting together,” said Rosanna Hertz, chair of women’s and gender studies at Wellesley College and co-author of “Random Families,” a book on donor conception. “People want college-educated sperm, so to speak.”So banks were getting desperate. One recruiter told me that she had started advertising at outdoor trailheads since gyms were closed. A sales representative at another sperm bank said that he was hoping management might offer cash bonuses to attract donors, but that his bosses were worried about setting a precedent.Another reason the banks were struggling was that they follow strict Food and Drug Administration rules. Sperm has to be quarantined for six months after a donation, and men have to return each time a batch is released and be blood tested. Most of the banks have limits so a donor cannot give to more than 25 or 30 families, to prevent widespread genetic concerns down the line. The donors are always unknown to the recipient families, identified by numbers. Almost all banks now offer the men’s childhood photos. Some have adult photos.Countries like England and Australia make it illegal to pay sperm donors significant amounts of money. In the United States, the F.D.A. does not set a financial limit, but it regulates sperm donation the way it does all tissue donation. A donor must consent of his own free will, without coercion. The banks follow the American Society for Reproductive Medicine guidance that payment should not be a donor’s primary motivation.“We are not paying them for their sperm, as you cannot purchase or sell human tissue,” Mr. Allard said, adding that the payments are technically reimbursements for time and travel.Mr. Allard said Seattle Sperm Bank was doing everything it could to make itself safe for the men who were still around. Only six are allowed to donate each hour, versus the dozen or so who might have popped in before. They are given temperature checks and the standard battery of Covid-19 screening questions. Everyone wears a mask, though the men can remove it when they make their deposit.Despite supply problems, the demand for pandemic babies seems insatiable. I wrote to the fertility center Kindbody, which has six locations around the country and specializes in in vitro fertilization.“Kindbody’s patient volume has increased by over 30 percent compared to pre-Covid levels,” wrote Rebecca Silver, the director of marketing. She said Kindbody had heard from women that donors they liked were all sold out or had wait lists.Mr. Allard said he had recently offered 35 vials produced by a particularly handsome blue-eyed, black-haired male, which is a rare combination.“I put him up at 6:30 a.m., and he was gone before 10 a.m.,” Mr. Allard said. “We’d never seen that before.”I twitched a little hearing this, knowing I might have missed out on excellent sperm. I check the banks a few times a day, but not that often.The price of sperm remains the same: high. Each vial from a premium bank can cost up to $1,100. The bank guarantees a vial will have 10 million or 15 million total motile sperm. Each month, during ovulation, a prospective mother (or her doctor) thaws a vial and injects the sperm. The recommendation is to buy four or five vials per desired child, since it can easily take a few months of trying to get pregnant. And since donors sell out fast, if a woman wants two children with the same donor, she needs to be ready with about $10,000.“A lot of people have been waiting for their lives to slow down to start their family, and now that’s happened,” Mr. Allard said. “Some of them might be thinking it will be easier to raise a child while working from home. I can tell you, though, I have three kids, and it is not easier.”As people have been fighting over remaining sperm at the banks, thousands of women have been trying to find another way.In the last six months, many have joined Facebook groups to look for the off-brand megadonors, the sperm kings. These guys have no family limit. They do not pay much attention to F.D.A. rules.They can also give would-be parents something that sperm banks cannot: their names. While most banks don’t release identities until the children turn 18, if at all, these men are “known sperm donors.”Almost all of them offer their sperm free.The change started happening a few years ago. Technology had already revolutionized how the sperm and egg donor world worked, with cheap and popular DNA tests making donor anonymity a farce. Now social media and a comfort with Tinder-like swiping and Uber-like simplicity were ushering in another revolution to bypass the sperm banks altogether.Apps for finding donors, like Modamily and Just a Baby, popped up. So did Known Donor Registry, where some 50,000 members arrange the giving and receiving of sperm. Facebook groups with tens of thousands of members — where men will post pictures of themselves, often with their own children — began advertising themselves to interested parties.On these Facebook groups, particularly handsome men are bombarded in the comments by dozens of women.Within three hours of one recent post from a 5-foot-9, 28-year-old nurse, who said he was “of English descent but tans like a Greek,” there was Megan writing, “Hi Jack, we have messaged you.” And Lindsay: “Hi Jack, I’ve messaged you.” And Sonia: “Hi Jack I’d like to have a chat.”It can get overwhelming.“I really didn’t come on here to be a pez dispenser style donor,” one donor wrote recently, explaining why he would be more discerning and might be slower responding to requests.Others advertise their smarts. John in Arizona wrote: “I have a 1,400 chess rating and am an analyst. I have a peaceful demeanor and high spirits. I exercise regularly, prefer rollerblades.”Most donors specify that they will donate only through A.I., artificial insemination. Some will also donate via N.I., natural insemination, or sex. The line between altruism and a sexual kink can get murky quickly and raises safety questions.The legal risk for both parties — risk that a mother will ask the donor for child support, and risk that a donor will want custody — is high, and the laws around this are not consistent in every state. The women who turn to Facebook groups for sperm tend to be unable to afford traditional sperm banks.Some in the known-donor world can also become territorial, claiming certain geographic regions and ousting new men who try donating to women in those areas. Two of the biggest sperm donor Facebook groups — Sperm Donation USA and USA Sperm Donation — are in a cold war with each other.“You can end up developing some disturbing dynamics,” said Dr. Hertz, the Wellesley professor, who has studied these communities.Many of the known donors use relatively inexpensive sperm shipping tools like Natal Donor or sperm analysis and storage firms like Dadi Kit. They also use consumer-friendly DNA tests like 23andMe or CircleDNA, which offer close to sperm-bank-level genetic testing to assure women that the donor’s genes do not carry mutations.Elaine Raby Byrd, 37, a kindergarten teacher in Memphis, said she had used a donor from one of the major Facebook groups and was in her “two-week wait,” the weeks after insemination but before she can take an accurate pregnancy test.“I get to pick who I want genetically rather than picking somebody who randomly I met,” she said.It also means, Ms. Byrd said, that she can choose a donor who is smarter and more attractive than someone she meets romantically day to day. “You can’t just force anybody to marry you,” she said. “I’m very independent.”There are now “known sperm donor” influencers.One is Kayla Ellis, 27, a stay-at-home mother of one in the Midwest. She and her wife found their donor on Just a Baby in 2019. They talked for weeks, though she kept her location secret just in case. She tracked her ovulation, and when it was time, they went to a bank (a financial one) to get an agreement notarized, then to a family friend’s Airbnb that was gifted to them for the occasion. There they transferred semen via a cup.“We were able to comfortably support children, but we couldn’t afford the crazy financial strain that I.V.F. and sperm banks would cost,” Ms. Ellis said. “So we started looking elsewhere.”Now she has a TikTok account devoted to “how to conceive a child through private sperm donation, track ovulation and how to talk to donors.” It has over 91,000 followers. And she and her wife are pregnant with their second child — same donor, same notary, same free Airbnb.“Our babies cost $136 each,” Ms. Ellis said.Probably the most famous superdonor is Ari Nagel, who has been going direct to consumer for over a decade. A charming professor in New York City, he gives his sperm quite freely and has a handful of paternity suits to show for it.He is currently in Zimbabwe donating, then headed to Nigeria. He said he had 15 women pregnant across the United States at the moment.But in the pandemic, it has all become bigger.“I’d like to know and have that peace of mind for myself that the child is going to a good home, instead of someone picking from a clinic and you don’t know who they are,” said Adam Hooper, who founded Sperm Donation Australia, which has 9,800 members and is a hub for finding free known sperm donors. His group has gained more than 3,000 members since the lockdowns started in March.“When a pandemic is happening, is it human instinct to want to reproduce?” Mr. Hooper said.The chatter on the Facebook groups frequently features negative news about sperm banks, such as donors being mixed up accidentally or intentionally. A sperm donor might also be lying about who he is, and that is a risk someone going to a traditional sperm bank has to take. Anytime a donor is revealed to be secretly a fertility doctor, the known donor message boards light up.Many of the donors and their interested recipients talk about loneliness. The men often do not have families of their own but think their genes deserve to survive. They worry that won’t happen. Many of the women are single moms by choice.“I have a strong desire to know my genes have been passed on,” one donor recently wrote on Just a Baby. “Like many of us, I’m not in a position to do so at the moment nor do I foresee this is in the near future.”One popular 30-year-old donor in Sperm Donation USA uses a pseudonym, Jacob San, since he worries about the impact on his career.“At first I just wanted to get my numbers up,” he said, meaning the number of children he could produce in the world. “But after three or four, that faded.“Now I have this vision of me being in my 50s and 60s, and I have a large dinner table, and I’m inviting all my donor kids to join me for dinner to tell me their stories, their journeys,” he continued. “I want to hear all of their adventures. This is the thing that pushes me.”A donor on Known Donor Registry told me that he used to donate to a big sperm bank but that it was too clinical and cold. He wanted to know who was buying his sperm, and wanted to feel that the recipients would raise the offspring well. So now he gives it away to people he talks to first.He told me his real name. He has an Ivy League M.B.A. and a sweet smile. We have mutual friends on Facebook. By the end of the chat, he had offered me sperm.Lance Oppenheim contributed reporting.</body>

	<title>‘Hateful’ Tweet About Stacey Abrams Costs University Football Coach His Job</title>
	<author>Neil Vigdor</author>
	<body>An assistant football coach at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga lost his job after smearing Stacey Abrams and the state of Georgia in a tweet that perpetuated unsubstantiated claims of election fraud, university officials said on Thursday.The coach, Chris Malone, was in his second season as an assistant and offensive line coach for the Mocs, according to a biography that was removed from the university’s athletics website.Mr. Malone made the disparaging comments about Ms. Abrams, a former gubernatorial candidate and onetime Democratic House leader in Georgia, on Tuesday night after the runoff elections for the U.S. Senate in Georgia — races won by Democrats that will give them control of the Senate. “Congratulations to the state of GA and Fat Albert @staceyabrams because you have truly shown America the true works of cheating in an election again!!!” Mr. Malone wrote. “Enjoy the buffet Big Girl! You earned it!!! Hope the money was good, still not governor!”Mr. Malone later deleted the post, but not before other people took screen shots of it and widely shared it on social media. “That tweet was hateful, hurtful and untrue,” Steven R. Angle, the university’s chancellor, said in a video posted on Thursday by the university on YouTube. “Coach Malone is no longer a part of this university.”Mr. Angle said that Mr. Malone failed to meet the expectations of university faculty and staff to lead in way that maintains a respectful and tolerant campus environment.  “The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga does not tolerate and unequivocally condemns discrimination and hatred in all forms,” Mr. Angle said. Efforts to reach Mr. Malone were not immediately successful. His Twitter account had been deactivated, and no phone number was listed for his address in Chattanooga.Ms. Abrams has been credited with helping President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. to carry the state in November and in the victories of the two Democratic senatorial candidates this week. She has fought efforts to suppress participation by Black voters across the country.UT-Chattanooga has about 12,000 students. The Mocs play in the Southern Conference, which postponed competition in fall sports, including football, because of the coronavirus pandemic.Rusty Wright, the university’s head football coach, said in a statement that a member of his staff had crossed a line with a social media post. “What was posted on social media by a member of my staff is unacceptable and not any part of what I stand for or what Chattanooga Football stands for,” Mr. Wright said. </body>

	<title>His Job Is Counting Stephen Curry’s 3-Pointers. You’d Retire, Too.</title>
	<author>Scott Cacciola</author>
	<body>Fred Kast has seen plenty of basketball in his 57 years as the official scorer for the Golden State Warriors — some good, some bad, some amazing. After Stephen Curry scored 62 points for the Warriors on Sunday night, Kast got a telephone call on Monday morning from one of his closest friends.“You know, after every basket that Curry made, I could hear him shouting, ‘Thank you, Fred!’” Kast recalled his friend telling him. “He was pulling my leg.”Kast, who will turn 82 this month, has recorded every field goal, every free throw, every foul and every timeout in nearly every Warriors home game since 1963-64. He jots the stats into an N.B.A.-issue, spiral-bound notebook that goes to the league office at the conclusion of each season. In a league that has seen its share of technological advances, the official scorer — the person who logs each game’s most vital elements — is a throwback, and every team has one. Somewhere in the N.B.A. archives, there is a small library of Kast’s handiwork.Kast has refined his craft through about 20 coaching changes, 23 playoff appearances and four championships, manning the scorer’s table at no fewer than six arenas, including the Cow Palace, the San Francisco Civic Auditorium and Oracle Arena. But nothing lasts forever, and Kast is set to retire after the Warriors’ game against the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday night. As the news began to circulate among his friends and colleagues this week — Kast wanted to keep it quiet — they tried to register what it meant.“It’s a shock to the system,” said Brett Yamaguchi, the team’s longtime senior director of game operations. “He’s been such a part of the fabric of Warriors basketball.”Kast had not planned on stepping away this season, but disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic made him realize that it was time. Staff members who sit at the scorer’s table this season need two virus negative tests, collected 24 hours apart, in the three days before a game. That means Kast sometimes must make an extra three-hour round trip from his home in San Jose, Calif., so that he can be tested at the arena.“And my night vision isn’t what it used be anyway,” Kast said.The pandemic has been difficult for him in other ways. His wife, Nita, is ailing and lives in a skilled nursing facility. Because of coronavirus protocols, Kast has rarely been able to see her, he said, and when he does, it is through panes of glass. They have been married for 41 years.“If I could change places with her, I would gladly do it,” said Kast, who has two stepchildren and three grandchildren.Ahead of retirement, Kast has kept busy, working three home games already this week. He will be replaced by Kyle McRae, who has spent 30 years as a Warriors statistician. Kast has been tutoring Kevin Chung, who will assist McRae, providing Chung with copies of his work from a few recent games so that he could study them — and a couple of blank pages so that he could practice on his own.“The game is not going to stop because you don’t record something right,” Kast said. “It’s not an easy thing. But it becomes easier the more you do it.”Before he became the N.B.A.’s executive vice president of basketball operations, Kiki VanDeWeghe was a high-scoring forward whose own stats were documented by Kast on multiple occasions.“He helped set the model for how to do the job of official scorer at a high level,” VanDeWeghe said. “I’ll miss seeing him in his seat at center court.”Growing up in Rahway, N.J., Kast may have gotten his basketball genes from his mother, Marie, who played a half-court version of the game as a young woman. His father, Fred, worked at a brokerage firm on Wall Street and kept his car in a garage that had a basketball hoop nearby.“So I would go shoot hoops while my dad was washing his car,” Kast said.Kast was predisposed to the game for one other reason: He was tall. By the time he reached high school, he was nearly 6-foot-6 and a promising low-post presence. He eventually left for Duke on a basketball scholarship, helping the team win its first Atlantic Coast Conference championship. He also had a memorable matchup with Jerry West, who was then starring for West Virginia.“I think he scored something like 30 points in the first half,” Kast said, “which gives you some clue as to how effective I was on defense.” (Kast was being somewhat modest; West scored only 29 points in that game.)After graduating, Kast left for California to work in sales for a medical supplies company. As much as he loved the game, he thought his only connection to basketball moving forward would be as a fan. He was about to stumble into a part-time job that would keep him closer to the action than he could ever have imagined.“Just unknowingly being in the right place at the right time,” he said.In the fall of 1963, not long after relocating to the Bay Area, Kast bought a ticket to watch the Warriors — and Wilt Chamberlain, whom he had once met at a summer basketball camp — at the Cow Palace, the arena that was housing the team after its cross-country move from Philadelphia. Before Kast reached his seat, he bumped into a college friend who was working at the scorer’s table. The friend asked Kast if he would be willing to help.“Sure, I’d be glad to do that,” Kast recalled telling his friend. “Where would I be seated?”“Right at midcourt,” his friend said.Kast said he became the team’s official scorer later that season. For four seasons, he commuted from Sacramento, battling late-night fog on his 90-mile drive home. After he retired from his sales job of 37 years in 1999, he continued scorekeeping, a gig that he treated with painstaking professionalism.“Well, I’ve been that way with everything that I’ve done,” he said. “My view is, if you’re going to do something, do it right or don’t do it at all.”Yamaguchi, who is in charge of non-basketball entertainment for the team, got a sense of Kast’s meticulous nature when he sat next to Kast at the scorer’s table in his early days on the job. They made an odd pair. While Kast sat with his pad and pens, Yamaguchi supervised “all the craziness,” as he put it.“Fred is such a purist,” Yamaguchi said, “and I just remember hearing, ‘Hey, can you turn down that music?’ And I’m like: ‘OK, Fred! Definitely!’”People who get jobs on the scorer’s table for the Warriors tend to keep them. Jim Maher has worked for the Warriors in various capacities for over 50 years, most recently as their game-clock operator. Lori Hoye has been the team’s chief statistician since 1989, and now leads a four-person crew that tracks in-game stats on a computer system.Hoye, 61, has long worked closely with Kast, whose scorebook is the official record and whose penmanship is precise. (“What happens if the computers break down?” Kast said.) He uses two pens: a black one to take notation in real time and a red one to compile totals at the end of each quarter.“We’re all trying to make sure we have the same numbers,” Hoye said. “Coaches get in your way. Players get in your way. And we’re always trying to figure out the refs’ fingers when a foul is called. The worst thing is to have players with the Nos. 45, 54 and 9 on the court at the same time.”She laughed and added, “It’s not going to seem real when Fred isn’t here.”Kast will continue to watch the Warriors from home — and “Dancing With the Stars,” one of his favorite television programs. In some ways, it might be easier for him to enjoy the team’s theatrics now that he no longer needs to pay close attention to his work. He marvels at the speed of the modern game, and at the skill of players like Curry.“His shotmaking ability is uncanny,” said Kast, who never thought he would have a front-row seat for so long.He is grateful that he had one at all.</body>

	<title>Gunmen Storm Wake in Mexico, Killing at Least Nine</title>
	<author>Oscar Lopez</author>
	<body>MEXICO CITY — At least nine people were killed in central Mexico as gunmen opened fire at a wake late Thursday, the local authorities reported, with images on social media showing bloody bodies strewn near a coffin and people who had collapsed on the street.The shooting took place outside a private home in the city of Celaya in Guanajuato State, according to the local authorities, who said one wounded person had been taken to a hospital. Some local media outlets reported that the death toll could be as high as 13.The attack occurred at about 9 p.m. in the Arboledas de San Rafael neighborhood. Security forces were searching for those responsible, according to the Secretariat of Citizen Security, a local agency in Celaya.Rapid gunfire could be heard in videos on social media that appeared to have been recorded at the scene.The attack is the latest to roil Guanajuato, once a relatively peaceful region, which is at the center of a turf war between rival criminal groups.The state, home to tourist destinations like San Miguel de Allende, has lately become one of Mexico’s deadliest. In July, 26 people were killed after armed men stormed into a drug rehabilitation facility in the city of Irapuato, the latest in a series of violent attacks that have taken place across much of the country.A center for car manufacturing northwest of Mexico City, Guanajuato averaged at least nine homicides a day in 2020, one of the highest murder rates in the country.The bloodshed in Guanajuato is largely the result of a territorial dispute between the Santa Rosa de Lima cartel and the larger and more powerful Jalisco New Generation cartel, which has expanded operations into Guanajuato. That raging conflict has led to soaring violence and several mass killings.“The situation Guanajuato is facing is very serious,” Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, said at a news conference after the massacre in July. “There is fighting between gangs, and in the majority of cases it’s aggression between them.”Despite a promise to deliver peace with “hugs not bullets,” Mr. López Obrador has been unable to make a meaningful dent in Mexico’s surging violence. More than 31,000 people were killed between January and November of last year, according to official figures.In December, a former governor of the state of Jalisco, Aristóteles Sandoval, was gunned down while vacationing in the resort city of Puerto Vallarta, in one of the most high-profile political assassinations in Mexico’s recent history. Security experts said the Jalisco New Generation cartel was the most likely culprit.Mr. Sandoval’s killing came just months after a brazen attempt to assassinate Mexico’s police chief, which was also tied to the Jalisco cartel.</body>

	<title>The Deplatforming of President Trump</title>
	<author>Ephrat Livni</author>
	<body>As President Trump belatedly conceded defeat in the 2020 election — after lawmakers and, reportedly, his own cabinet members weighed how to remove him from office — he has found himself with ever-fewer avenues to speak out online, underscoring the power of internet giants and an abrupt shift in how they treat his behavior online.Facebook extended Mr. Trump’s ban from its platforms for at least two weeks, blocking him for the remainder of his term. “We believe the risks of allowing the president to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great,” Mark Zuckerberg wrote in announcing the move. The breaking point was Wednesday’s unrest, he told employees.Amazon’s livestreaming service Twitch, the e-commerce company Shopify and PayPal also shut down accounts associated with Mr. Trump or his supporters. YouTube adopted a new policy that makes it easier to suspend the president and others for pushing false election claims. Mr. Trump regained access to Twitter after being locked out for 12 hours. Though the company had temporarily blocked the president on public safety grounds, its C.E.O., Jack Dorsey, made clear publicly that he wouldn’t follow through with more stringent measures — for now. Commentators speculated that the quasi-concession speech that Mr. Trump posted after the suspension may have been an effort to avoid permanent exile.He’s at risk of losing much of his influence without mainstream platforms. Mr. Trump’s Facebook and Twitter accounts were valuable assets from which to wage political battles and garner media coverage. Being consigned to much smaller networks like the conservative-leaning Parler and Gab “wouldn’t likely satisfy the president’s desire for a mass audience” and could leave him at a disadvantage should he try to remain a force in the Republican Party or run again for president in 2024, The Times’s Kevin Roose writes.That kind of power has some worried. Critics on the left and right have sought to curtail legal protections that shield internet platforms from liability for their users’ content, and the issue is sure to remain front and center when President-elect Joe Biden assumes office. That said, even Ajit Pai, the Trump-appointed chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, didn’t object to Facebook and Twitter blocking his boss.In other fallout from the Capitol mayhem: The Justice Department refused to rule out pursuing charges against Mr. Trump for his possible role in inciting the violence; more administration officials have resigned; and several companies fired employees who were spotted participating in the mob violence (and one firm suspended its C.E.O., who was arrested at the Capitol).The U.S. surpasses 4,000 Covid-19 deaths in a day. The country reported another grim record, putting its total death toll from the disease at over 365,400. Meanwhile, scientists worry that the Capitol rampage was a super-spreading event.President-elect Joe Biden names his pick for commerce secretary. He will nominate Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island, a former venture capitalist, for a role that is a key liaison with the business world. But because of delays in Congress, Mr. Biden may not have a single cabinet official confirmed before his inauguration, a break from the norm.Boeing settles a 737 Max investigation for $2.5 billion. The fine resolves a criminal charge by the Justice Department that the plane maker conspired to defraud the Federal Aviation Administration in the wake of two deadly crashes.SoFi is going public via SPAC. The online lender will merge with a blank-check fund backed by the investors Chamath Palihapitiya and Ian Osborne. Anthony Noto, SoFi’s C.E.O., said that the company had considered staging an I.P.O. but preferred the certainty of a SPAC deal.Guess where Bitcoin is trading now. If you said “setting yet another record,” congrats: The cryptocurrency has surpassed $40,000 per coin and roughly doubled in price over the past month.Our take yesterday on the accountability of business leaders who backed President Trump really struck a chord, based on all the thoughtful feedback we received from readers. Thanks to all who shared their thoughts (and keep them coming).After a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol on Wednesday, some of the president’s former allies in the business world have begun rethinking their relationship with him. The billionaire investor Nelson Peltz, for example, said he regretted supporting Mr. Trump’s re-election, but defended his economic policies.“Big business struck a Faustian bargain with President Trump,” The Times’s David Gelles writes. They issued vague statements when he flirted with authoritarianism and applauded his leadership when he cut taxes and reduced regulation.The former Starbucks chief Howard Schultz told David that the 2017 tax cut, perhaps the administration’s signature economic achievement, “seduced” business leaders but turned out to be “fool’s gold.”The Carlyle Group’s David Rubenstein told Andrew that “I don’t think that condemnation today is the most important thing.” He added, “I don’t know that my voice means as much as the voices of people that have been elected.”This cognitive dissonance is what got us here, Daniella Ballou Aares, the C.E.O. of the Leadership Now Project and a former Obama administration adviser, told DealBook. When it comes to Mr. Trump’s autocratic tendencies, “there are more than a few businesspeople who thought they could wait it out,” she said. “Now it’s clear you can’t ignore it.”Elon Musk is now the richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, taking the title from Jeff Bezos. To be fair, they’re both worth nearly $200 billion, so who’s counting?Debating a criminal referral. The Jan. 6 House committee has grown divided over whether to make a criminal referral to the Justice Department of former President Donald J. Trump, even though it has concluded that it has enough evidence to do so. The debate centers on whether a referral would backfire by politically tainting the expanding federal investigation.A Trump ally agrees to cooperate. Ali Alexander, a prominent organizer of pro-Trump events after the 2020 election, has agreed to cooperate with the Justice Department’s newly expanded investigation of the attack on the Capitol last year.The effort to disqualify “insurrectionists.” New lawsuits were filed against three Arizona officials, including Representatives Paul Gosar and Andy Biggs, to bar them from office under the 14th Amendment. This is part of a larger legal effort to disqualify G.O.P. lawmakers from re-election if they participated in events surrounding the Jan. 6 attack.Contempt charges. The House voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino Jr., two close allies of Mr. Trump, after the pair defied subpoenas from the special committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.First acquittal. A federal judge decided that a man who claimed that the police let him into the Capitol during the Jan. 6 riot was not guilty of four misdemeanors, the first acquittal connected to the sprawling investigation of the attack.Tesla’s stock price surge is what put Mr. Musk over the top. The electric car maker’s shares have risen more than 700 percent over the past year. They now trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of around 1,600, versus 30 for the S&amp;P 500 and 20 for rival auto companies like G.M.His unusual pay package was very well timed. Recall that an audacious compensation plan, approved in mid-2018, gives Mr. Musk big chunks of shares tied to “a series of jaw-dropping milestones based on the company’s market value and operations,” as we wrote at the time. Tesla was worth around $60 billion back then, and experts considered the plan’s upper limit, a market cap of $650 billion, “laughably impossible,” since it would have made Tesla one of the five largest companies in the U.S.You can guess what happened: Tesla just passed Facebook to become the fifth-most-valuable listed company on Wall Street, at more than $770 billion. On what this meant for his net worth, Mr. Musk said yesterday: “How strange.”Some of the academic research that caught our eye this week, summarized in one sentence:Anticipation of a big tax cut didn’t account for much of the gain in stocks in 2017, so a potential hike may have a modestly negative effect. (Anthony Diercks, Daniel Soques and William Waller)As China shifts away from labor-heavy manufacturing, it isn’t clear which country will take its place. (Gordon Hanson)“We exploit a 2016 nonaggression pact between gangs to examine how collusion affects extortion in areas where gangs previously competed.” (Zach Brown, Eduardo Montero, Carlos Schmidt-Padilla and Maria Micaela Sviatschi)As companies and regulators increasingly see climate change as a business threat, the data company Gro Intelligence is devising indexes that it says can track climate risks down to specific locations or assets — and could create a new class of financial investments.The company is offering indexes to measure conditions like drought, floods, temperature and more, according to its co-founder and C.E.O., Sara Menker. Its drought index, for example, aggregates 46 variables that the company’s software transforms into a measure of drought severity on a scale from zero to five. Beyond helping clients like Unilever, which already uses Gro’s data for sustainability planning at its Knorr brand, the indexes could be used to build an array of derivatives, like swaps that companies and investors can use to hedge climate risks, said Ms. Menker, a former Morgan Stanley commodities trader.Even as the indexes could be used to create and price swaps, catastrophe bonds and even exchange-traded funds, Ms. Menker can’t predict what else could be built on them: “People always ask, what do you do next? I say, I don’t know what we’re going to do next.”The demand for climate-related financial products is growing, as companies seek more data to gauge the risks to their supply chains and guard against environmental risks. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission recently published a sweeping report declaring climate change a systemic risk and urging development of financial hedges and investments. Unlike insurance products, which are usually bespoke and limited in what they cover, Gro’s indexes are based on standardized data that allows for comparisons of assets around the world, Ms. Menker said. And unlike many existing indexes, she said, her company’s products can be applied to assess the risks to specific physical assets like individual farms or factories.Gro has raised $85 million to help fund its efforts, we’re the first to report. The new round — which surpasses the $50 million target the company set last summer — will be announced later today and was led by Intel Capital, a partnership between TPG Growth and EchoVC, and the family offices of Ronald Lauder and Eric Zinterhofer.Gro also recently signed up a new board member: Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs president and Trump economic adviser, who was initially asked to find weak spots in Gro’s indexes. “As financial institutions and companies are increasingly required to disclose climate risk, universally trusted and transparent data will be very important,” Mr. Cohn said.DealsRobinhood may sell some of its shares directly to users when it goes public this year.

	<title>Your Friday Briefing</title>
	<author>Melina Delkic</author>
	<body>(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning.We’re covering the latest from Washington, a new study of in-flight coronavirus transmission and our Travel Desk’s 52 places to love (since who knows when we’ll go anywhere).Since World War II, much of Europe has looked to the U.S. as a democratic model. The headlines in newspapers around the world on Thursday showed something else.The images of a mob overrunning the U.S. Capitol Building on Wednesday touched a nerve in fractured Western societies, our Paris bureau chief writes: If it could happen at democracy’s heart, it could happen anywhere.President Trump released a video on Thursday in which he condemned the violence of the day before, when supporters he had urged to march on Congress stormed the building. He conceded that a “new administration” would be sworn in on Jan. 20.But his statement did little to quell the uproar within the government and among broad swathes of the American people.Rising backlash: There were growing calls for Mr. Trump’s immediate removal from office and threats of another impeachment. A wave of resignations robbed him of some protectors and allies, and the Republican Party was splintering. The editorial board of The Wall St. Journal, a bellwether for the conservative establishment, urged Mr. Trump to resign.Facebook announced it would block him from posting through the end of his term, and the Justice Department refused to rule out filing charges against him.The rioters: The mob included infamous white nationalists, conspiracy theorists, a newly elected West Virginia lawmaker — and a lot of more anonymous people who had traveled from other states to heed Mr. Trump’s call to support his efforts to overturn the election. Here’s how they breached the Capitol.Race and policing: That the overwhelmingly white intruders so easily overran the police and suffered no mass arrests drew criticism, especially from those who recalled harsher treatment at racial justice marches. “You can be arrested for walking while Black, but you can be white and riot and basically get away with it,” said Attica Scott, a Kentucky state representative who was arrested in Louisville last summer.Most research into possible coronavirus transmission on airplanes has focused on flights that occurred last spring, when the value of preventive measures was not broadly understood. A new report details what can happen even when airlines and passengers are aware and more cautious about the risks.The flight: An 18-hour trip from Dubai to New Zealand in September on a Boeing 777-300ER that was three-quarters empty. On arrival in Auckland, the 86 passengers quarantined for two weeks, as required.The findings: Seven passengers, all of whom had been seated within the same four rows and two of whom had not worn masks, tested positive during the quarantine. The versions of the virus they carried were virtually identical genetically. Research led by New Zealand’s Ministry of Health determined that one passenger — who had tested negative four or five days before boarding — had initiated a chain of infection that spread to at least four others.Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.In other developments:Officials in France, where about 45,000 people have been vaccinated, vowed on Thursday to speed up the campaign. “2021 will be the year of hope,” Prime Minister Jean Castex said, but he added that infections and hospitalizations remained too high to loosen restrictions, end curfews or allow bars and restaurants to reopen on Jan. 20, as planned.A vaccine made by the Chinese company Sinovac is effective, Brazilian officials said. More than 300 million doses have been sold, mostly to low- and middle-income countries, and many have been shipped in anticipation of national approvals.There are deepening fears that the Capitol riot in Washington could have been a super-spreader event, not only among the throngs of unmasked intruders, but also for the Capitol Police and the lawmakers locked in with one another for hours during the rampageItaly, along with Romania and Poland, sends the most European workers abroad. And the proportion of Italians living abroad who have a university degree is higher than that of Italy’s general population.But in the past year, the number of Italians aged 18 to 34 returning home increased 20 percent over the previous year, according to the foreign ministry.Italy has been celebrating. “The counter-exodus of the brain drain,” declared Italy’s Il Sole 24 Ore newspaper in September. “Now young people want to come back to Italy,” proclaimed Il Giornale di Sicilia.Caveats: Many of those returning are still working for foreign businesses. And they may not stay. Brunello Rosa, an economist in London who is a member of the diaspora, said that they “create value abroad and income abroad” — and that just spending their salary in Italy doesn’t have a significant impact on the country.Varun Suchday, of Bhuj, India, is always on the lookout for roads that don’t exist on maps, talking to locals to get their directions. When the pandemic hit, he heard of special rock formations in Kaliya Dhrow, India. He rode a motorcycle for hours and eventually happened upon “this marvelous, endless landscape of red: streaks of crimson, saffron — orange.”He’s one of the readers who have shared stories about some of their favorite spots during a dark year.

We could quickly and easily select the communities with the most new coronavirus cases per capita over the previous two weeks. We should also focus on places with a minimum absolute number of newly infected people, to gain critical mass and avoid having the scarce vaccines dispersed across small populations.Write better algorithms. Everyone using algorithms for vaccine distribution should follow key principles, including: making sure the algorithm’s outcome is what we actually care about, taking the time to do a dry run, building public trust, and monitoring and updating your algorithm even after vaccine deployment.That’s it for this briefing.

	<title>The Pandemic Helped Reverse Italy’s Brain Drain. But Can It Last?</title>
	<author>Emma Bubola</author>
	<body>When Elena Parisi, an engineer, left Italy at age 22 to pursue a career in London five years ago, she joined the vast ranks of talented Italians escaping a sluggish job market and lack of opportunities at home to find work abroad.But in the past year, as the coronavirus pandemic forced employees around the world to work from home, Ms. Parisi, like many of her compatriots, seized on the opportunity to really go home, to Italy.In between Zoom meetings and her other work for a recycling company in London, she took long strolls on the beach near her family’s home in Palermo, Sicily, and talked recipes at dawn with vendors in the local market.“The quality of life is a thousand, thousand times better here,” said Ms. Parisi, who is now in Rome.As with so many things, the virus has upended a familiar phenomenon — this time Italy’s longstanding brain drain. How much things are changing, and how permanent those changes will be, is a source of debate in the country. But something is clearly different.Italy, along with Romania and Poland, is among the European countries that send the most workers abroad, according to figures from the European Commission. And the proportion of Italians living abroad who have a university degree is higher than that of Italy’s general population.Taking into account the money the country spends on their education, Italy’s brain drain costs the country an estimated 14 billion euro (about $17 billion) every year, according to Confindustria, Italy’s biggest business association.Italian lawmakers had long tried attracting back talented workers with tax breaks, but a grim job market, high unemployment, a baroque bureaucracy and narrow avenues for advancement continued to draw many Italian graduates abroad.Then the virus seemed to do what years of incentives could not.In the past year, the number of Italians aged 18 to 34 returning home increased 20 percent over the previous year, according to Italy’s foreign ministry.“The counter-exodus of the brain drain,” declared Italy’s Il Sole 24 Ore newspaper in September. “Now young people want to come back to Italy,” proclaimed Il Giornale di Sicilia. L’Espresso magazine last month called 2020 “the year of the turning point, of the return.”The Italian government has welcomed the return of some of the country’s best and brightest as a silver lining to what has been a brutal pandemic for Italy, calling the shift a “great opportunity.” There is also a financial benefit, as Italians who spend more than six months in the country have to pay their taxes there.Paola Pisano, Italy’s minister for technological innovation, said at a conference in October that Italy had a chance to benefit from the skills and innovations that returning Italians brought back with them.She also said Italy needed to do its part to keep them there. For one thing, the country needs “a strong, diffuse, powerful and secure internet connection,” she said, so that those who had moved abroad “can return to their country and keep working for the company they worked for.”One group of Italians started an association called Southworking to promote working remotely from Italy’s less developed south, in the hopes that returning professionals would dedicate their free time, and their money, to improving their hometowns.“Their ideas, their volunteering, their creativity stay on the land where they live,” said Elena Militello, the association’s president, who returned to Sicily from Luxembourg. To promote remote working, the association is creating a network of cities equipped with fast internet connections, an airport or train station nearby, and at least one co-working space or library with good Wi-Fi.To map them, the association has received help from Carmelo Ignaccolo, a doctoral student in urbanism at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who returned home to Sicily after the coronavirus hit.In recent months, Mr. Ignaccolo has overseen exams with the Mediterranean in the background of his Zoom screen, taught classes near his great-grandfather’s olive press and taken refuge from the heat by studying in a nearby Greek necropolis.“I 100 percent embrace an American professional life,” he said, “but I have a very Mediterranean lifestyle.”It’s not only Italy’s south that is benefiting from the reverse traffic.Roberto Franzan, 26, a programmer who built a successful start-up in London before taking a job at Google there, returned to his home in Rome in March.“You go to the bar and you can just strike up a conversation with pretty much whoever,” he said. “It has worked great for me.” He said that a number of interesting start-ups and tech companies were popping up in Italy and that he could imagine investing in the country.“This moment has given us all the time to realize that getting back to your roots can be a good thing,” he said.Italy’s business leaders have urged the government not to squander the opportunity.“Coronavirus, the about-face of the brain drain,” Michel Martone, a former deputy labor minister, wrote in the Roman newspaper Il Messaggero. He urged lawmakers to find a way to retain the “extraordinary army of young people who returned home in the face of the emergency.”But some experts say there aren’t really that many advantages to solidify.While many Italians may have moved back to the Tuscan countryside or to Sicilian beachfronts, their minds are still benefiting American, British, Dutch and other foreign businesses.“Zoom is not going to solve Italy’s problems,” said Enrico Moretti, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley who focuses on labor and urban economics and is himself part of the Italian brain drain.Brunello Rosa, an economist in London who is another member of the diaspora, said that returned Italians “produce an activity for a foreign entity — they create value abroad and income abroad.” He added that “the fact that they spend their salary in Italy doesn’t really make a difference.”A more likely outcome, he said, is that the virus will lead to economic wreckage and huge levels of unemployment that will set off another wave of emigration as soon as European countries lift their lockdowns.To really address the issue, he and others said, Italy needs to undertake deep structural and cultural reform that streamlines bureaucracy and improves transparency rather than relying on “people who come back home because the food is worse abroad and the weather is bad.”Mr. Ignaccolo, the M.I.T. doctoral candidate, plans to return to the United States to pursue his academic career, and the new company Mr. Franzan, the programmer, is launching will be based in Delaware.The downsides of working in Italy also worry Ms. Parisi, who is concerned that her professional advancement would be stymied in what she sees an Italian business world that has narrow scope for younger workers. She allowed that London’s lack of sun was bleak and British food was bad for her skin, but said that other things were important in life, too.“I am young, I am a woman and I am in a very senior position,” she said, explaining that she would return to her job in London when her office reopened.“It was a unique opportunity. I could both keep the job and live in Italy,” she said of her time working there. “But I always knew it was going to be temporary.”</body>

	<title>A Capitol Police officer dies from injuries sustained during the pro-Trump rampage.</title>
	<author>Mike Baker</author>
	<body>A United States Capitol Police officer died Thursday night from injuries sustained when he engaged with a pro-Trump mob that descended on the U.S. Capitol the day before.Officer Brian D. Sicknick died at about 9:30 p.m. on Thursday, the Capitol Police said in a statement. He had been with the agency since 2008.Mr. Sicknick was responding to the riots on Wednesday and “was injured while physically engaging with protesters,” the agency’s statement said, although officials didn’t immediately elaborate on the nature of his injuries or how he interacted with the crowd. After sustaining the injuries, Mr. Sicknick returned to his division office, collapsed, and was taken to the hospital.“The entire U.S.C.P. department expresses its deepest sympathies to Officer Sicknick’s family and friends on their loss, and mourns the loss of a friend and colleague,” the statement said. News outlets had prematurely reported on his death earlier in the day while he was apparently still on life support.Homicide investigators from the Metropolitan Police Department are involved in the case.Early Friday morning, Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio, a Democrat who runs the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the budget for the Capitol Police, said in a Twitter post that his heart was breaking over Mr. Sicknick’s death. “This tragic loss is a reminder of the bravery of the law enforcement who protect us every day,” Mr. Ryan wrote.Mr. Sicknick’s death brings the death toll from Wednesday’s mayhem to five. One of the people participating in the pro-Trump rampage, Ashli Babbitt, was shot and killed by a Capitol Police officer inside the building as she climbed through a broken window leading to the Speaker’s Lobby. Three other people died after experiencing apparent medical emergencies in the area around the Capitol, the police said.Officials have said that some 50 police officers were injured as the mob swarmed barricades, threw objects, battered doors, smashed windows and overwhelmed some of the officers who tried to resist the advancing crowd. Capitol Police reported 14 arrests during the incursion, including two people who were detained for assaulting a police officer. Local police arrested dozens of others, mostly for unlawful entry and violations of the city’s Wednesday night curfew.Steven Sund, the Capitol Police chief, handed in his resignation on Thursday after facing pressure from congressional leaders. The sergeants-at-arms of the House and Senate also resigned.</body>

	<title>They Met in a Car Pool, Now They’re Married</title>
	<author>Vincent M. Mallozzi</author>
	<body>In the early days of their relationship, Kayla McCulley and Matthew Spencer created a book club — for two.“We both love to read,” said Mr. Spencer, 34, an assistant professor of electrical engineering at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, Calif.He first met Ms. McCulley, 33, in November 2016, when both worked at the Claremont Colleges in Los Angeles. When Ms. McCulley joined a car pool for faculty and staff residing in nearby Pasadena, Calif. — the only time she took part in it — she was introduced to Mr. Spencer.“I remember a very wonderful conversation in the car that night,” said Ms. McCulley, a manager of industry engagement at 2U, an education technology company with headquarters in Lanham, Md.“But I happened to be in a relationship at that time,” said Ms. McCulley, who graduated from Pomona College and received two master’s degrees, one in business administration and the other in sport management from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. She was also a Fulbright scholar in Switzerland from 2009-2010, where she conducted research on European sports law.They parted ways but Tinder soon put them on another course, this one in May 2017.“I was very excited,” Mr. Spencer said. “Though I must admit, I needed a bit of a nudge to remember having met Kayla previously through the car pool.”Ms. McCulley provided the nudge, and two weeks later, Mr. Spencer took her on a whirlwind first date that included a stop for coffee and churros, followed by some bookstore browsing and ending with blues dancing lessons.On their sixth date, the book club was created.“That’s about the time when we first started getting serious,” said Mr. Spencer, who graduated from M.I.T. and received a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley.“We often discussed our favorite books with one another,” he said. “That became a great way to learn new things about each other, and to feel more comfortable when in each other’s presence.”When asked if their book club has since been shelved, Ms. McCulley said, “Oh no, in fact, it has become a pillar of our relationship.”“Our love of reading is one of the values we hold most important to us,” Mr. Spencer said. When we realized just how much we had in common, our hope was that everything we did together would lead to marriage.”They took a big step in that direction when they moved in together in an apartment in Pasadena in August 2018, and an even greater step when they became engaged in September 2019. Mr. Spencer proposed while visiting Ms. McCulley’s family in Black Butte Ranch, Ore.They were married Dec. 19 at the Captain Whidbey Inn on Whidbey Island in Coupeville, Wash. The bride’s grandfather, John H. Clark, who became a Universal Life minister for the occasion, officiated.A second ceremony with the groom’s family followed on Dec. 28, at the Greater Des Moines Botanical Gardens in Des Moines.The couple originally planned a 150-person wedding outside Seattle for July 25 2020. With those plans sidelined by the pandemic, they decided to hold two small separate ceremonies with each of their families in Washington State and Iowa.“From the time of our first date, which was so unpredictably spectacular, I knew I had met someone really, really special,” the bride said. “He is very intelligent, very handsome and very committed — and best of all, he’s mine.”</body>

	<title>What Trump Shares With the ‘Lost Cause’ of the Confederacy</title>
	<author>Karen L. Cox</author>
	<body>Wednesday morning, President Trump urged a crowd of supporters who showed up in Washington, D.C., to “walk down to the Capitol” and protest the certification of the election taking place nearby on Pennsylvania Avenue. A few hours later, he stood in the White House Rose Garden to deliver a different message after members of this same group — who carried flags bearing his name — stormed the Capitol, brawled with Capitol Police and breached both chambers of Congress. Mr. Trump repeated false claims about election fraud but told them: “You have to go home now. We have to have peace.”As the Trump presidency comes to a close after a sound defeat, and after four years of having led a movement that many agree has undermined our Constitution and the nation itself, it is difficult not to see the parallels between his lost cause and the failed cause of the Confederacy in 1865. As individuals carried the flag of the Confederacy, the flag of rebellion against the United States, into the Capitol, it was a moment not lost on historians — and a moment of dire concern for most Americans.Mr. Trump’s feeble message to his stalwarts about going home and keeping the peace was similar in tone to Gen. Robert E. Lee’s admonitions in the aftermath of defeat. “I think it wiser,” he wrote, “not to keep open the sores of war, but to follow the examples of those nations who endeavored to obliterate the marks of civil strife.”Lee was referring to the creation of monuments, but he was essentially telling those who admired him to “go home” and keep the peace. Yet by the time he made those comments in 1869, the myth of the Lost Cause and its justifications for Confederate defeat were in full flower. And it was Lee — not President Jefferson Davis, whom many white Southerners blamed for their loss — that helped to personify the narrative of a just cause. He was a leader who had not failed the white South; rather, he had been failed by others. He was also the man they believed best represented the values of their cause.Mr. Trump’s lost cause mirrors that of Lee’s. His dedicated followers do not see him as having failed them, but as a man who was failed by others. Mr. Trump best represents their values — even those of white supremacy — and the cause he represents is their cause, too. Just as Lee helped lead and sustain the Confederacy over four years, Mr. Trump has also been a sort of general — in a campaign of disinformation.And if there was ever a campaign of disinformation, the Lost Cause was it. The Confederacy, the lie went, failed only because of the North’s superior numbers and resources. But it went further than that. As Edward Pollard, the Richmond editor who coined the term “Lost Cause” wrote in 1866, “The Confederates have gone out of this war,” he wrote, “with the proud, secret, dangerous consciousness that they are the BETTER MEN, and that there was nothing wanting but a change in a set of circumstances and a firmer resolve to make them victors.”This constitutes another parallel to the movement Mr. Trump has created. Under a change in circumstances — overturning the results of the election — the better man would have won. This is the “dangerous consciousness” of Trump’s supporters. Like Lee’s Lost Cause, it will not likely end. When Lee died just five years after the Civil War, the myths around Confederate defeat and efforts to memorialize it were growing exponentially throughout the South. The Lost Cause did not belong to Lee; Lee belonged to the Lost Cause — a cultural phenomenon whose momentum could not be stopped.Even if Mr. Trump were to remove himself from public life in the coming years, his lost cause and the myths he’s helped create about elections, voter fraud and fake news will likely continue, a cultural and political phenomenon that shows no sign of ending.Like the original Lost Cause, today’s movement has been aided and abetted by the president’s field generals — many of them Republican members of Congress. They espouse the same language, stoke the same flames and perpetuate the same myths — all to incite a base of voters to keep them in office. It also ensures that the “sores of war,” received in battles to restore white supremacy in the face of an increasingly diverse polity, not only remain but become gaping wounds that fester with racism, sexism, homophobia and nativism.There is a saying that the South lost the war but won the peace — that military defeat did not stop the Confederate cause and that the Lost Cause was not entirely lost. It was won through the rewriting of history, electing officials who sought to reestablish political and social control over freedmen and women, through violence and draconian legislation, and by perpetuating the mythology that theirs was a sacred cause and that white Southerners were a patriotic people who had done nothing more than to try to preserve states’ rights.Mr. Trump’s tweet to his followers echoed these same sentiments. He referred to his cause as “sacred” and to those who supported him as “great patriots” and admonished them to “Remember this day forever!” This is how the original Lost Cause emerged, and if history repeats itself in the decades ahead, Trump Republicans will continue to defend what he began, think of it as a patriotic duty, and not only will they “never forget,” they will most likely perpetuate these sentiments onto future generations.This is how the myth of Lost Cause played out in the states of the former Confederacy. It grew in strength, found support among white Northerners and has lasted for generations such that even today, more than 150 years later, people defend its basic tenets.Mr. Trump’s lost cause, however, is far more dangerous because it affects more than a region; it is national in scope. It has ensnared everyone from Senators Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas to over 130 Republican members of the House to the Proud Boys and Women for Trump. Democrats may be able to win general elections, but Trumpism will live on in Republican-dominated legislatures whose members remain in power, in some cases at least, because of voting restrictions and district gerrymandering.The constant refrain coming from Republican leaders is that the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol is “not who we are.” And yet how else are we to explain what happened? If it is not who we are, then all members of both parties should reject this 21st-century lost cause. But too many Republicans haven’t — and unless they do, its impact could last for generations.Karen L.

	<title>Juggling My Children, Their Alcoholic Sitter and My Own Sobriety</title>
	<author>Sarah Twombly</author>
	<body>Tonight I left my children with our longtime babysitter, who claims she is nine days sober, but is possibly drunk or high.At the very least, she is exhausted — the kind of exhausted that seeps into your bones and calcifies. I am leaving my children with her because I trust her. Four years, she has cared for my children. She has made them paper crowns and cardboard castles, bathed them and sung them to sleep. She and I have lunched and sipped tea. Together, we have summited mountains of paperwork to secure her health insurance, a new car, a new apartment.I know her, I trust her. This is the mantra I repeat to myself from my office upstairs, where I am listening to every thump and bump and giggle below.I am in the house. I didn’t leave. It’s the middle of a pandemic; no one leaves anymore. That’s how I know my children will be alive when I finish working. But as the night goes on, I start checking the baby monitor, because my children are not in bed and it is after 8 o’clock, after bedtime, late and getting later. When they finally appear — my 5-year-old daughter doing a cartwheel, my 3-year-old son dragging his blankies, the babysitter, alert and smiling — I release a breath I had not realized I was holding.How many days of sobriety do you need to babysit? To be trustworthy? Seven days? Thirty days? Ninety days? Conventional wisdom holds that the physical symptoms of alcohol withdrawal — the nausea and sweating, the shaking and disorientation — usually subside in three to five days.The babysitter says she has nine days sober, but we all lie, every addict, every alcoholic. I detoxed in the hospital’s drunk tank. On day two of sobriety, I had a seizure. On day six, I had a panic attack. On day nine, I could put on my own pants, barely.But the struggle doesn’t end with the physical. It’s mental. The misery of protracted withdrawal — dysphoria, depression, irritability — can drag on for weeks. Twelve-step programs refer to this as “the monkey on your back,” because the cravings weigh on you, pick at you, natter in your ear about how much more bearable this conference call, this meal, this round of hide-and-seek might be with a drink. My first sponsor insisted I find a job and keep busy, which I did, and I stayed sober.Tonight, I’m paying it forward. I am giving the babysitter a job. I am keeping her busy. I am hoping she stays sober.But what if I weren’t an alcoholic? Would I have asked her to leave? Would I have said I’m not comfortable, and sent her away? This babysitter has become something more akin to family. She has told me stories of being dragged through her childhood like a fiberglass boat through the shallows: a father who left, a mother who did her best, a grim foster care placement, and the briny scrape of countless other dangers, both visible and not. This babysitter — whose heart is miraculously intact despite the damage it has endured, including a recent brush with death and viral cardiomyopathy — could I have asked her to leave?The Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous says she should stay. Being of use is important, it says. The fellowship of another alcoholic is crucial, it says. Still, I wish she hadn’t confessed. I wish she hadn’t told me over the kitchen island, in front of the children as they were eating spaghetti, as they were eating her every word, saving their questions for the morning when I know they will ask me, What is drinking? What is sober? Why is her face so fluffy?They do not know what it is to be bloated. They do not understand edema or addiction. They have never seen me drink alcohol, not once, not ever. I will have to explain it to them. They share my blood, so it’s possible that this thing, this alcoholic affliction may be metastasizing in them, even now, as they lie in their beds, chattering back and forth. I will have to explain at least part of it to them in the morning.Someday they will want to know all of it. How I stopped drinking. How I writhed as the alcohol and dope leached out of my system. How I was dry. For years I was dry, like a desert, like the air in winter, like a pile of ash. Angry. Pimpled. Thirsty. That first year, I locked myself away in a halfway house where I learned how to shower, how to clean a toilet, how to cook spaghetti, how to wash a dish, how to make a bed, why you should care about making your bed. And AA meetings every day. For three years, every day. I had the Big Book nearly memorized — the acceptance passage, the serenity prayer, How It Works, the steps and traditions. I remember so little now.I’ve been sober 18 years, so long I don’t even think about drinking and drugs anymore. Not really, anyway. Not often. Definitely not every day. But once in a while, maybe out at dinner with friends, when someone orders a red wine, or a beer, or a vodka tonic.Vodka. I’d like seven vodka tonics. I’d like to slip inside a bottle of vodka, to bathe in it, to slosh, just for the night, just for a little while.That’s how I know my addiction is still there, still lurking, still hungry. After 18 years it’s probably ravenous, but it’s not starving. Starvation is something you die of, and addiction cannot be killed. You can’t excise or eradicate it. You have to contain it. Dam it. Barricade it. Even then, it whispers. Through whatever levees you erect, it gurgles. It splashes out a Morse code of desire. You become a certain kind of deaf, a certain level of numb, all the time, every day. That’s the work. That is how you progress from drunk, to dry drunk, to sober human. You’ll never be just human. You’ll always be a sober human — a person almost, but not quite.My babysitter has nine days sober. When she tells me, she says how proud she is. I have given her my children for the night. When I go downstairs, they will be asleep, or will be in bed contemplating going to sleep. She and I will talk. I will tell her what it was like, what happened, what it’s like today. I will tell her half-truths — not even. She will tell me what it is like for her right now, today, with her nine days sober. I will believe half of what she says — not even.Tomorrow night, she will watch my children again. She will hold them, and her soon-to-be 10 days, as tightly as she is able. I know her, I trust her. She will keep the children as safe as she knows how. I pray their laughter and shrieks and glee will keep her safe in return. These are the things alcoholics do for each other. These are the things that keep us sober. These are the things I hope someone would do for my children, should they need it.Sarah Twombly is a writer and mother to two young children. Update, Jan. 10, 2021: The babysitter was involved with the writing of this essay, and gave her consent for it to be published to both the writer and the editor.</body>

	<title>State and local governments have been slashing jobs.</title>
	<author>Jeanna Smialek</author>
	<body>State and local governments continued to cut payroll employment in December, a sign that a crucial sector was bleeding jobs nine months into the pandemic.Those governments account for about 13 percent of employment in the United States, which makes their trajectory extremely important to the nation’s labor market outlook. Because most are required to balance their budgets, lower income or higher expenses can lead to big job cuts.State and local employers shed 51,000 workers in December compared with the prior month. As of last month, they reported 1.4 million fewer jobs than in February, the month before the pandemic job losses started.The big employment cuts come despite revenue losses that appear milder than many analysts had expected at the pandemic’s outset. Louise Sheiner at the Brookings Institution estimated in a recent post that states would miss $350 billion in revenue over three years. Meanwhile, by her estimation, they received about $280 billion in direct and indirect federal aid in a March relief package, and about $120 billion more — largely indirectly — with the most recent fiscal package.But expenses have shot up as the states try to deal with the public health crisis, which could leave budgets under strain even as federal aid helps to overcome revenue shortfalls. And the economic hit from the virus has not been evenly spread — some places are struggling more acutely.From an employment standpoint, it’s also important that states were finalizing budgets when worse outcomes were expected, and may have cut back as a result, Ms. Sheiner wrote.“What we’re seeing is that it’s different state to state,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said at a news conference in December. But he pointed out that many employees had been cut from state payrolls, at least temporarily. “We’re watching carefully to understand why that many people have been let go and what really are the sources,” he said.</body>

	<title>Another Thing a Triceratops Shares With an Elephant</title>
	<author>Becky Ferreira</author>
	<body>In a lush, bygone landscape, a hungry Triceratops munches on low-lying ferns and cone-bearing cycad plants to power its 10-ton frame. The animal swallows huge mouthfuls of roughage, seeds and all, before ambling off in search of new feeding grounds.Days later and miles away, the Triceratops empties its bowels, sowing the seeds of the plants it ate, complete with fertilizer, in more far-flung soil than could be reached without it.The dispersal of plant seeds within the bodies of animals, known as zoochory, is so common in modern ecosystems that plants often tailor their fruits and flowers to appeal to specific carriers. Fossils of poop and gut contents indicate that plant seeds also hitched rides in dinosaur bellies, though it’s unclear if these relationships were as widespread and sophisticated as they are today.George Perry, a forest ecologist at the University of Auckland who studies human pressures on seed dispersal, got to thinking about this topic during New Zealand’s coronavirus lockdowns.“I know from modern ecosystems that large animals are important seed dispersers,” Dr. Perry said. “I thought, I’ve got all the pieces: What’s the most massive animal ever and how far might it have moved seeds?”In a study published Wednesday in Biology Letters, Dr. Perry laid out a framework for calculating how far dinosaurs — ranging in weight from roughly 20 pounds to 90 tons — might have carried the seeds of prehistoric plants. He found that dinosaurs such as Triceratops or Stegosaurus had the right mix of size and speed to deposit seeds between three and 20 miles from parent plants. That’s comparable to the African bush elephant, which transports seeds across a mile and a half on average, but can move them as far as 40 miles.Dr. Perry’s simulations depend on two main factors: the speed of a dinosaur and the amount of time it retains seeds before eliminating them. It’s challenging to pin down these values because of the limitations of the fossil record. That said, body mass is linked to walking speed and seed retention time in modern animals, which can be used as a rough analog for past ecosystems.“What we really want to be able to do is get a GPS tracker and put it on a dinosaur and follow it around, but we can’t do that,” Dr. Perry said. For this reason, the study’s assumptions are “reasonably conservative,” he added.Large animals typically travel farther, and retain seeds longer, compared with smaller animals. But extremely massive dinosaurs, such as the 90-ton Argentinosaurus, may have been slower than midsize herbivores. That means grazers like Triceratops were probably the most effective dispersers of seeds because of their more modest body sizes yet still prodigious appetites.“Seed dispersal potentials of extinct animals are of great importance, and Dr. Perry estimated those of dinosaurs in a sensible way,” said Tetsuro Yoshikawa, a plant ecologist at the National Institute for Environmental Studies in Japan who has published research on this topic.“Since extant terrestrial animals, such as elephants and bears, can transport seeds several kilometers in some cases, it is possible for large-sized dinosaurs to have similar potentials.”Dr. Perry’s study is “a great example of how with clever lateral thinking, a scientist can come up with ways of getting insight into a question that — at face value — could only be answered with a time machine,” said John Hall, a plant ecologist at the University of Queensland and an expert on cycad plants.Of course, it would be wonderful if scientists could plunge elbow deep into real dino dung, à la Ellie Sattler in “Jurassic Park.” Alas, the finer details of these complex ecosystems will most likely remain shrouded in mystery and speculation.“When we look at the natural world today, the diversity and intimacy of the close symbiotic relationships between plants and animals that pollinate flowers and disperse seeds is just staggering,” Dr. Hall said.There is “no reason not to think that the spectrum of such relationships must have been equally complex and diverse in prehistoric times,” he added, even if “those relationships must remain tantalizingly lost to us.”</body>

	<title>As an Intense Winter Unfolds, Some Lessons From Herbalists </title>
	<author>Jenna Wortham</author>
	<body>Humans have relied on plants for their healing properties as long as we’ve been incarnated on this planet. Sumerian clay tablets from ancient Mesopotamia contained instructions for the herbal preparation of more than 200 different plants, including poppy and mandrake. A Neanderthal burial site discovered in the 1960s contained branches of a bush known to contain ephedrine, commonly used to treat breathing ailments, and several wildflowers that also have medicinal properties. Harriet Tubman was a skilled wildcrafter who used her knowledge of plants to keep babies quiet while she helped their parents escape slavery and tended to Union soldiers during the Civil War.In “Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and the Teachings of Plants,” Robin Wall Kimmerer gently teaches readers how to see and receive the bounty of land as a gift. “The thriving of one in the best interest of the other,” she writes. “This, to me, sounds a bit like love.” Last summer, under the weight of the pandemic and social justice protests, I turned to my deep network of Black, Latino and nonbinary herbalists around the country, who were generously sharing their ancestral knowledge of plants online to care for their communities and help them cope with the waves of grief, anxiety and depression. As we head deeper into the winter season, I spoke to several of those herbalists about how they are preparing themselves, their families and their communities for the intensity of the months ahead.“In a moment of intense transition, I’m asking myself questions like: Are you rested? If not, what can you do to rest,” said Marisa Hall, 28, a Black femme community herbalist in the Bay Area. “Let’s reframe rest as part of the work. That’s really easily lost. We see rest is the antithesis of revolution or productivity but it is the bank — it’s what is going to allow any of us to do any type of work sustainably. And especially for Black people, it can feel impossible to just rest, but it’s so important.”“I’m slowly learning to expect less from myself and to let go of trying to function at 100 percent,” said Salimatu Amabebe, founder of a food collective called Black Feast in Portland, Ore. Mr. Amabebe recalled the terrifying fires that swept the Pacific Northwest, damping the sun and polluting the air for days. He and his family still haven’t recovered. “It’s challenging to manage your mental health right now and not fall into a state of total apathy while still trying to work from home and meet deadlines.”“Even though I am in California, and we don’t really have seasons, I still try to align with the energy of winter,” said Jamesa Hawthorne, 29, an herbalist in Los Angeles. “It’s a good time to do dream work. I like mugwort for that. It helps with my mental health, to go inside my imagination and play a little bit. I use tinctures and tea blends with kava kava.”&quot;I am a chef, and I love how we can integrate medicine into our foods,” said Candace Taylor, 38, who lives in Winooski, Vt. “I love using cinnamon, star anise, cardamom in dishes, which all support lung health. Same with curries made with cayenne, turmeric, cumin and mustard seed, which is so powerful for lungs.” She also loves using eucalyptus, she added, “in a diffuser or even taking a hot bowl of water, placing plants like wintergreen, ginger, rosemary or cinnamon into the water, and draping a hot towel over your head and lowering your face to the bowl for a quick steaming session.”“I’m growing mushrooms for the first time this year,” said Cheré (rere) Bergeron, 33, an herbalist in Minneapolis. “I put reishi and chaga mushrooms into everything I make, including my elderberry syrups and my bone broths. They also have a lot of vitamin D, and as we head into winter we aren’t getting enough sunlight and that’s also important. In fall and winter, the energy of the plants is traveling downward, back into the earth, so this time of year, eating things that grow in the ground can mirror that action and in our own bodies, helping to slow down so we can rest and move slower, at the speed of molasses.”“The very first plant that I picked in herbalism school — like an herbal tarot card — was yarrow,” said Arvolyn Hill, 31, an educator and herbalist in Harlem. “It’s an abundant plant on the land I grew up on, it’s a warrior plant.” “Part of the challenge of preparing winter medicines for my own household is making sure there’s something my wife, Naima, who is a picky eater, and a variation that Luna, my 3-year-old daughter, can take,” said Suhaly Bautista-Carolina, 34, an herbalist in Brooklyn. “We do a lot of hot chocolate, made with plant milk and those big bricks of Mexican chocolate, and I add heating spices, like cinnamon, nutmeg or star anise, and a bay leaf for good fortune. It is a very family-friendly way to get plant medicine in.”“Nourishment and hydration is important,” said Berenice Dimas of Hood Herbalism, an educational herbal community and resource in Oakland, Calif. “I am checking my capacity more regularly and taking screen and social media breaks when possible. Along with all these little things, I am also sharing information with people that are taking my herbal classes. They are learning different ways to bring in plant medicine to support us during these times.”</body>

	<title>They Got Married on a Mountaintop</title>
	<author>Tammy La Gorce</author>
	<body>Erica Ingraham had her eye on Adam Koster from the moment they started working together in 2015 in the town of Bon Accord, in Alberta, Canada. This was not an easy thing to do, given the setting.Ms. Ingraham, 30, and Mr. Koster, 33, were youth leaders at Oak Hill Ranch, a therapeutic program for high-risk children. The demands of the job didn’t allow much time for adult interaction, let alone a flirtation. But Ms. Ingraham did her best to let Mr. Koster know she was interested. There was the time they were out walking children around the ranch and she stepped on a wasp’s nest: “I was getting attacked by wasps and he was sweeping them off my legs and I was like, ‘Adam, you are amazing,’” Ms. Ingraham said. “But he didn’t think anything of it.”Mr. Koster remained oblivious to Ms. Ingraham’s crush for more than a year, until she invited him to her house after an off-campus hangout with colleagues. “I was like, ‘You know what? You should come home with me,’” she said. He told her she was drunk and said no, but that invitation set the wheels of romance in motion. “After that, I finally got that she had been trying to hang out with me,” he said.They started dating in 2017; by April of that year, they were a couple, splitting their time between his house in Morinville and hers in St. Albert.Not that they spent a lot of time indoors. Ms. Ingraham and Mr. Koster hike, bike, ski and snowboard. Their passion for those pastimes, plus a new job for Mr. Koster as a conductor of Canadian National freight trains, brought them to Calgary in late 2017. “We’re outdoorspeople,” Mr. Koster said. “We wanted to be closer to the mountains.” Ms. Ingraham found a new job in Calgary as a youth leader at Trellis, a local community group.By 2019, they were discussing marriage. The next year, on a long-awaited trip to Amsterdam, Mr. Koster proposed. “On our first day there I decided I couldn’t wait any longer and I asked her to marry me,” he said. Ms. Ingraham said yes. The date was March 7. Within a week, the world would start shutting down because of the coronavirus.“We got pretty lucky,” Mr. Koster said. “We got a flight home just before Justin Trudeau issued major restrictions on flights.” Planning a wedding became a pandemic project. Both liked the idea of a small mountain wedding, but accommodating both their families brought their guest list close to 100. They settled on a March 2021 wedding at Canmore, a town in Alberta, then scrapped that plan in favor of a more intimate event for 14 on Dec. 13 at Lake Louise, a local ski resort where they often spend long days snowboarding. “To me, it’s the most beautiful place in the world,” Ms. Ingraham said.But the wedding for 14 wasn’t to be, either. In late November, Mr. Trudeau issued further restrictions on indoor gatherings to head off a spike in Canadian coronavirus infections. “So we finally decided, if we can’t have everyone come, we won’t have anyone come,” Ms. Ingraham said. The temperature at Lake Louise was 25 below zero on the day of their hastily arranged Dec. 13 mountaintop elopement. Only three people attended: a friend, Haagen Sagli, who was certified that day as a wedding commissioner, and two witnesses, Sara Forbes and Alex Moffatt.Ms. Ingraham, in a backless white gown, braved the cold with a fur shawl and snow pants under her dress for the 10-minute ceremony. Mr. Koster refused to let the arctic air alter his wedding look: “I just went with the suit I was planning on wearing for the indoor wedding,” he said.When Mr. Sagli pronounced them married, they didn’t hang around the mountaintop to celebrate. “We said, ‘Let’s go!’ And we got on our snowboards for our first run together as a married couple,” Ms. Ingraham said. “It felt pretty special.”</body>

	<title>¿Qué pasó en Washington?</title>
	<author>unkown</author>
	<body>Es el primer viernes de 2021, un año que de pronto parece solo una secuela recargada de 2020. Aquí tienes algunas de nuestras mejores lecturas en español.Las vimos todos, las imágenes de desorden y caos en el Congreso estadounidense: vidrios rotos, gases lacrimógenos, multitudes desatadas con indumentaria de camuflaje, saqueo. En todo el mundo hay episodios de tumulto legislativo y violencia. Esta vez se sentía distinto. ¿Lo era?La escena de “una turba desbandada en la ciudadela de la democracia”, como la describió Peter Baker en esta estupenda crónica, era, más bien, una terrorífica postal del derrumbe del excepcionalismo estadounidense: “esto no es Estados Unidos”, dijo una congresista en la capital. ¿Qué estaba pasando?Minutos antes de que irrumpieran en el Capitolio, el presidente Trump había arengado a la turba. Horas después, cuando les pidió que se marcharan, también les dijo a los extremistas que los amaba. Ayer se supo que ha coqueteado con la idea de otorgarse a sí mismo un indulto presidencial.Durante años, observa Ezra Klein, los republicanos dijeron que a Trump había que tomarlo en serio, pero no al pie de la letra. Esta semana fue más que obvio que sus partidarios sí interpretan sus palabras de manera literal.La madrugada del jueves, cuando los legisladores, ojerosos y enmascarados, al fin ratificaron la victoria de Joe Biden como presidente, el capellán del Congreso dijo en una plegaria: “Estas tragedias nos han recordado que las palabras importan y que el poder de la vida y la muerte reside en la lengua”.¿Qué vocabulario usamos para describir y entender lo que pasó? ¿Golpe, insurrección, ataque? Encontrar las palabras adecuadas no es solo un ejercicio de reflexión e introspección. También puede ser la diferencia entre un acto revelador y uno de rebelión.— Elda CantúUn golpe de Estado es un evento discreto, violento, que empieza y termina en poco tiempo. Pero, como discutieron los expertos con Amanda Taub en The Interpreter, hay otras formas de dañar la democracia más persistentes y silenciosas:“Ha surgido un patrón claro en el que los líderes llegan al poder a través de elecciones pero luego socavan las normas, desmantelan las instituciones y cambian las leyes para retirar las restricciones a su poder. Al final, sus países son, excepto en nombre, dictaduras”.En el planeta solo quedan dos rinocerontes blancos del norte. Las chicas, como les dicen sus cuidadores, se llaman Najin y Fatu, son hembras y pasan sus últimos días en el extraño ocaso de su especie, algo que los científicos llaman “extinción funcional”.Frente a la extinción, hay un problema de empatía, escribe Sam Anderson:“Los 7700 millones de humanos no pueden pasar una semana con las chicas, lo que significa que la humanidad en general jamás rascará a Najin por la mañana ni sentirá su tibio resoplido. La humanidad jamás las amará realmente. Entonces jamás actuaremos, colectivamente, con la única clase de urgencia que podría resultar efectiva”.Que tengas buen fin de semana. Si te gustó este boletín, compártelo con tus amigos, colegas y seres queridos (y no tan queridos). Y cuéntanos qué te pareció.</body>

	<title>Mike Tomlin Reaches Another N.F.L. Postseason With Fewer Black Peers</title>
	<author>Jonathan Abrams</author>
	<body>Maurkice Pouncey, the Pittsburgh Steelers’ Pro Bowl center, has been around Mike Tomlin long enough to decipher his coach’s body language.“You see him, and then the next thing you know, he’s so locked in,” Pouncey, a Steeler since 2010, said during a recent telephone interview. “You’re like, ‘Dang. I know not to mess around.’ ”Most players under his leadership came to respect Tomlin’s ability to wed football acumen with a sense of fairness and a consistency, engendering a behind-the-scenes kinship and historic success on the field.He has not had a losing campaign in his 14 seasons as a head coach, navigating the Steelers through controversies that could capsize other franchises. Through it all, Tomlin’s stone-cold facial expression has been as much of constant as the Steelers’ postseason berths — Pittsburgh hosts the Cleveland Browns in the first-round of the playoffs on Sunday evening — even as the N.F.L. has evolved greatly since he became the youngest head coach and second African-American coach to win a Super Bowl after the 2008 season at age 36.“He’s never lied to anyone,” Pouncey said. “And I think sometimes people get it misconstrued that he’s somewhat of a player’s coach. And I get it. He’s really cool with the players, but then when he comes in there, it’s all business.”In public, Tomlin is full of scowls and digestible platitudes showcased throughout games and in news conferences, a vastly different demeanor than his players see.“If you just listen to Coach T talk, he going to spit nothing but game at you,” said Ike Taylor, a cornerback who played a dozen seasons for Pittsburgh before retiring in 2015. “You just got to listen. He’s something like a pastor or a preacher or an evangelist. He just got a way with words where he can just reach out to anybody without even trying to.”Pastor Vernon Shazier occasionally accompanied his son, Ryan, to the Steelers’ facility before Ryan’s career-ending spinal injury in 2017. Tomlin, Shazier said, could tell someone that his play is unacceptable and warn the player that he’d soon be “going shopping” for a replacement if it continued, and then laugh with the player at his locker all in the same day.That candor allowed players like Taylor to forge what he described as an ongoing big-brother relationship with Tomlin.While Taylor was still active, Tomlin learned that he harbored aspirations of one day working in a team’s front office. Tomlin occasionally allowed him to eavesdrop on personnel discussions to gain a deeper understanding of the league’s behind-the-scenes maneuvering.“Until it was time for them to really do business, I had to get out,” Taylor said. “I was probably one of the only active players who could sit in draft meetings and sit in on draft day with the organization. He gave me the green light to do a lot of things active players usually couldn’t have done, but that was the relationship him and I had.”Tomlin’s steadiness has been felt especially this seesaw season amid the pandemic. Pittsburgh began the season by reeling off 11 straight wins before its pursuit of a perfect season evaporated with three straight losses, as defenses started encroaching on the aging Ben Roethlisberger’s short-passing game. The Steelers capped their season with another loss to Cleveland in Week 17, though Roethlisberger did not play.Tomlin declined to speak for this article and he’s rarely gone into depth on his background the way he did during a round table discussion this summer with Vernon Lee and Carl Francis, co-founders of the Hampton Roads (Va.) Youth Foundation.Tomlin has been involved with the organization since he started as an N.F.L. assistant in Tampa Bay, helping to mentor the area’s youth. “Carl and I have considered him a partner in this endeavor,” Lee said. “Not just someone who’s coming back as a guest. It still shocks me to be quite honest with him being the head coach for the Steelers, how hands-on he is.”The three men, all natives of coastal southeast Virginia, discussed familiar streets, high schools and area legends. Tomlin eventually discussed the one motto that drives him.“Young people don’t care what you say,” Tomlin said in the talk. “They watch you move.”Tomlin should know. In the round table, he detailed growing up in Hampton, Va., with his older brother, Ed, “a product of a broken home. My parents separated before my first birthday and myself and my brother, we moved back in with her parents,” he said, referring to his mother’s parents.People looked out for their own in the 757, the area code for the seven cities that make up the Hampton Roads community. Adults steered Tomlin. His stepfather, Leslie Copeland, was a large influence. Tomlin followed Ed’s path into football, joining a league at age 7. Coaches of other teams showed genuine interest in the well-being of the young wide receiver, proving to Tomlin that if it took a village, he had found the correct one.Tomlin envisioned a career playing football by the time he arrived at Denbigh High in Newport News, Va. He doodled plays in class to the chagrin of his freshman geometry teacher, Gail Gunter. She warned him before calling his mother, Julia, after he failed to turn in a couple assignments.Gunter challenged Tomlin. Two years later, Gunter served as a counselor for the students competing in Odyssey of the Mind, a scholarly competition. The other students had recruited Tomlin to participate in constructing a vehicle but Gunter could not locate him when it was time to start.“Mike would come moseying on in after all the football players had left because he didn’t want them to see him coming into something that was academic,” Gunter said.The team finished second in the state. Tomlin had asked the other students not to disclose his involvement, which coincided with him asking Julia not to display his honor roll sticker on her car’s bumper.At the College of William &amp; Mary, Tomlin continued drawing a distinction between football and his other pursuits. “I’ve referred to him before as a bit of a closet nerd even though he tries to downplay how smart he is,” said Terry Hammons, a fellow receiver and one of Tomlin’s closest friends at the university.David Aday, a professor of sociology and American studies, taught Tomlin in a criminology course. Tomlin sought to understand the racial, social and class links between mass incarceration, topics, Aday said, that are typically difficult to discuss.“The fact that he was a young Black man, some of the implications were a little more threatening, distressing,” Aday said. “There are a couple of ways you can deal with that. You can put your head down and say, ‘We’ll get through this conversation and move on.’ Or you can ask, ‘What’s going on here? What do we know that could help us to understand this?’”On the field, Tomlin talked trash to opponents and teammates alike, teetering the difference between inspiring his sideline and infuriating the other. He’d slyly caution Hammons to be safe before receiving punts — in essence, daring Hammons to return the ball.“Mike knew I had a bit of a Napoleon complex and he knew how to get me going,” Hammons said.Tomlin debated for more passes. He took over meetings with Hammons. During film reviews, Zbig Kepa, their receivers coach, sometimes dropped the remote on the table and told his boisterous crew to figure out the tape for themselves.“He was comedy on the field,” Kepa said. “Then, he would really keep that energy level going and communicate and ask questions in meetings.”His hopes of an N.F.L. career fading, Tomlin became the wide receivers coach at Virginia Military Institute in 1995, carving a path to stay involved with the game and using the intellect he had gained from studying it since his youth.He quickly worked his way up the college ranks with stops at Memphis, Arkansas State and Cincinnati, along the way learning the benefits of meticulously planning and documenting his days and charting goals in old Franklin Planners.“I got this Franklin Planner and I bought these cassette tapes, right?” Tomlin said during the round table. “And I committed to a day of watching these cassette tapes and organizing my life through this Franklin Planner. Just thoughts, quotes of the day, appointments, critical notes, call backs, et cetera, et cetera. I needed that organization because I was drowning in life at that time.”That propensity for planning paid off in 2007 when, after six seasons as an assistant in Tampa Bay and Minnesota, he interviewed to replace Bill Cowher as the Steelers’ head coach. Pittsburgh offensive coordinator Ken Whisenhunt and assistant head coach Russ Grimm were the favorites to win the job but Tomlin impressed owner Dan Rooney and team president Art Rooney II in his interviews by presenting a detailed plan for the franchise over the next calendar year.The Steelers appointed Tomlin as the franchise’s third head coach since 1969 on the same day that two Black coaches, Tony Dungy’s Indianapolis Colts and Lovie Smith’s Chicago Bears, met for the first time in the Super Bowl.“Mike ended up getting his job at a time when there was a lot of discussion about African-Americans being able to get a job, being able to hold it if you got it and who was qualified,” said Terry Robiskie, a longtime N.F.L. assistant coach. “It was always the discussion that they could never find anyone that was qualified.”Tomlin’s hiring was viewed as a success of the Rooney Rule, named after Dan Rooney, the former owner of the Steelers, that requires teams to interview minority candidates for high-profile vacancies. Tomlin joined six other Black men with N.F.L. head coaching jobs the year he was hired; with the Los Angeles Chargers’ recent dismissal of Anthony Lynn after the 2020 regular season, the number of Black N.F.L. head coaches is down to just two — Tomlin and Brian Flores of the Miami Dolphins — in a league where nearly 70 percent of players are African-American.Tomlin is now a veteran coach. The career of Roethlisberger, the Hall of Fame quarterback he inherited, is winding down. Members of the stingy defense passed down to him are long retired. Tomlin’s reputation as a player’s coach was dinged through running back Le’Veon Bell sitting out the 2018 season while seeking a new contract and Antonio Brown’s cycles of drama.Change has swept the broader N.F.L. landscape, too. As the N.F.L. has struggled with its place in the national reckoning on race, Tomlin last year came to the defense of backup quarterback Mason Rudolph, who is white and was accused of using a racist slur toward Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett, who is Black, during a brawl between the two teams.“He brings the perspective as a Black man with children, but he doesn’t try to force his view on his players and that’s what he’s done from the beginning,” Hammons said.Instead, Tomlin allows his players to deliberate issues collectively to land on a unified response, “allowing them to have a vested interest in the ultimate decision,” Hammons said.That was the goal in 2017. Tomlin allowed his players to debate on whether they would stand or kneel for the national anthem to draw awareness to racial injustice and abuse. The roster did not reach a consensus and decided to stay in the locker room before a game against Chicago. Alejandro Villanueva, an offensive lineman and Bronze Star Medal recipient, stood by himself in the tunnel as the song played.“I think whenever you’re a Black coach in his position, that other people put so much pressure on you to do everything,” Pouncey said. “And he’s not here for that. And if you really know Coach Tomlin, he’s a football coach. That’s what he loves. That’s what he dedicates his whole entire life to.”Decades ago, Robiskie met Dungy when the pair roomed together for the East-West Shrine Game, a postseason college showcase. Their paths paralleled. They became friends as part of a small number of Black N.F.L. coaches and sometimes vacationed together with their wives.After dinners, Dungy, by then Tampa’s coach, often brought up the name of a young coach on his staff, full of potential, learning by the day. “Mike who?” Robiskie, then an assistant coach with the Browns, would say. “Tomlin? I’m going to get him just like I get you.”Years later, Robiskie, now a running backs coach for the Jacksonville Jaguars, estimates that his teams are 0-19 against Tomlin.To Robiskie, Tomlin has extended the legacy of coaches like Dungy, Smith, Dennis Green and Art Shell while staying true to himself.The others, Robiskie said, were low-key personalities. “Mike was going to laugh and joke and scream and if he had to get upset and cuss and fuss, he was going to get upset and cuss and fuss,” Robiskie said.He added. “We’ve all got to tip our hats off to him. He’s brought that trophy there once before and I, for one, I get on my knees and pray he brings them another one.”</body>

	<title>How Restaurants Have Weathered the Pandemic</title>
	<author>Marie Tae McDermott</author>
	<body>Good morning.Nearly 40,000 restaurants in the state have been shuttered since last year, with California leading in the number of restaurant closures in the nation, according to the latest figures released by Yelp.In every corner of the state, loan payouts have been exhausted and state unemployment programs are stymied by bureaucratic delays.A survey by the California Restaurant Association, the group that challenged Los Angeles’s outdoor dining ban in court, found that 60 percent of restaurants that received federal loans said they would most likely run out of money by the summer. It also estimated that since March, between 900,000 and one million restaurant workers have either been laid off or furloughed.The $900 billion stimulus package Congress passed in December would give struggling small businesses another chance to apply for loans.But the relief may be too late for many. California is buckling under the latest Covid-19 surge, with intensive care units everywhere nearly filled to capacity. Much of the state is under stay-at-home orders, which bans all manners of dining at restaurants.Immigrant- and Black-owned restaurants are especially at risk of closing. A survey by the C.R.A. found that 60 percent of restaurants in California are owned by people of color. However, after the $2.2 trillion CARES Act was implemented in March, the largest benefits failed to reach many minority-owned businesses.One family-owned restaurant in the Inland Empire went from being a popular buffet spot to only serving takeout food overnight.The restaurant, Punjab Palace, located in a nondescript strip mall in Riverside, has been a part of the community since it opened 17 years ago, providing affordable Tandoori Indian food and rooms for banquets and events.When Gov. Gavin Newsom implemented the first stay-at-home order, the restaurant’s owner, Ashok Kumar, immediately closed the buffet, which, along with private events, was the largest source of income.The change to a takeout-only model has significantly lowered its bottom line. The lack of interaction with customers has also blocked a valve it once had into the community.Yashmeen Sharma, Mr. Kumar’s youngest daughter, said that much of her childhood was spent in and around the restaurant. She has seen children of customers grow up and start families of their own. Ordinarily, she would be able to recognize regulars.“The other day I was helping this lady who I’ve known for years now and I could not recognize her with her mask on,” Ms. Sharma said.With the loss of the buffet, Ms. Sharma, her parents and two sisters run the restaurant together, working 11 hours a day then going home to sleep. She said their daily income averaged around $800 per day, not nearly enough to make ends meet. Their monthly rent for the restaurant space is $12,000, and the landlord said they could defer to payments of $2,000 during the pandemic. However, the unpaid balance will have to be paid off eventually.The looming debt and loss of income is an ever-present worry for Ms. Sharma and her family. They have seen other longstanding immigrant-owned restaurants in their community close and the owners returning to their home countries.“To see that some of us aren’t going to make it through this is devastating,” she said.Mr. Kumar built the restaurant into a popular neighborhood spot over the years. After immigrating to the U.S. from India in 1988, he began washing dishes in Los Angeles, then working his way up through the industry’s rungs, according to his daughter.The family eschewed outdoor dining because of health risks. Both Mr. Kumar and his wife, Mamta Kumari, have pre-existing health conditions, making them particularly vulnerable to Covid-19. Their landlord would also require them to pay full rent if they opened any type of dining on the premises.Last year, they received an Economic Injury Disaster Loan from the Small Business Administration in addition to a smaller grant from the City of Riverside, which helped reduce — but did not wipe out — any accumulating debt.Ms. Sharma said she was optimistic that things would return to normal this year, but what normal looks like is unclear.After many buffets permanently closed their doors, the verdict on if the restaurant will ever be able to come back is still out.And yet, Yelp’s economic report found that while scores of restaurants have closed, over 6,000 have opened in California during the pandemic. The resilience of some businesses can be explained by how well they adapt to pandemic-era restrictions.At Punjab Palace, the family’s willingness to work together allows them to avoid hiring outside employees, thus saving critical funds. It also fosters a sense of safety and togetherness, not a small thing these days.“At least we’re alive, you know, we made it through the day not infected and we get to go home together,” Ms. Sharma said. “We make it home safe every day, even if that costs us.”(This article is part of the California Today newsletter.

	<title>How the Wealthy Are Maneuvering to Get the Vaccine First</title>
	<author>Ginia Bellafante</author>
	<body>Edward Goldberg’s phone would not stop ringing. A concierge doctor on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, Dr. Goldberg had been fielding calls from patients who went to St. Bart’s or Aspen — the wisdom of public-health officials be damned — and came back with Covid. All that faith in private air travel as a means of inoculation had failed them.But that was only part of the New Year’s onslaught. Many healthy people were calling, too, because they had an urgent desire for the coronavirus vaccine. It didn’t matter that their work, in so many cases, put them merely on the front lines of winning market positions — the vaccine was here, so surely there was a way to gain access to it immediately.Yet another contingent, still, was calling Dr. Goldberg’s office, inquiring about membership in his practice, operating under the assumption that they would then be fast-tracked for the vaccine. Concierge medicine involves the payment of annual fees — in Dr. Goldberg’s case, $20,000 a year — for what is essentially unlimited access to a doctor’s care. When asked how quickly someone might receive a vaccine, Dr. Goldberg is left to explain that New York State is levying huge penalties against any medical outfit that tries to game the protocols for distribution.“What Cuomo did really protects me when it comes to these pushy concierge types because I can say that I cannot risk the fines and loss of license,” Dr. Goldberg told me.In December, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo threatened sanctions of up to $1 million (and the revocation of the right to practice) against doctors, nurses, urgent-care providers or any others who delivered the vaccine unethically. On Monday he went further, proposing a law that would criminalize the administration of the vaccine to anyone trying to jump ahead in a line that prioritizes health care workers.But entitlement breeds nothing if not persistence. At a different concierge practice — that of Alexander Goldberg (unrelated to Edward Goldberg), who is also known as Dr. Hamptons for his oceanfront house-calls, and who offers everything from “lip enhancement” to “pain management” — temerity is also running high. “I’ve had people calling me left and right,’’ Dr. Hamptons’s son, Mark, who manages the empire, explained. “I say that we don’t even have the vaccine yet, and then they say, ‘Well, I’m the first guy you’re giving it to when you get it,’ and I say, ‘Yeah, uh-huh, sure.’”It was inevitable that in an era marked by inequity and radically conflicting interpretations of truth that the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine would be marked by so much delusion on multiple fronts. On the one hand are the rich, who are accustomed to finding workarounds whenever they want something that is in short supply and see little need for a different approach when it comes to protecting themselves from a disease that has largely devastated the underclass. When you are living the good life, you want to preserve it. For every 100,000 people lost to deaths of despair — attributable to poverty, joblessness, addiction and so on — there is at least one Silicon Valley billionaire putting millions of dollars into life-extension research in the hope that he can reach the age of 200.At the same time that there are so many desperate to resume the business of going to Paris or Reykjavik for the weekend and hosting dinner parties for 35, there are the skeptics who believe that the vaccine is trouble. In a survey of 1,117 Americans, conducted in early December, a quarter of respondents said they would not take the vaccine when it became available to them, while another quarter said that they were not sure.Some have voiced reasonable concerns about the speed with which the vaccines — from Pfizer and Moderna — were approved. But others have fallen prey to circulating conspiracy theories: The vaccine was going to sterilize you or alter your DNA or leave you with a microchip that would allow Bill Gates and the government to discover what you were really doing when you told your wife that you were going to Home Depot.A little over a week ago, Lara Devgan, in what has now become something of a pandemic ritual, posted a video of herself getting the vaccine on Instagram. Lara Devgan is a doctor but not a pulmonologist or an internist. She is a Park Avenue plastic surgeon with a skin care line sold at Sephora that includes something called Hyaluronic Serum for $245 a bottle. While it might have seemed odd that a cosmetic surgeon was getting a vaccine so soon — and publicizing it — she thought of her gesture as a public service. (She also works in emergency rooms doing post-trauma reconstructive surgery.)Some of her patients — those who have had cosmetic fillers — were worried that the vaccine would cause temporary facial swelling. This is indeed a very rare side effect. But the tabloid press had hyped it, and now Dr. Devgan was hearing from people who said they might skip the vaccine altogether because they preferred not to have laugh lines. Although one approach might be to skip collagen in the first place, Dr. Devgan wanted to show the world that you can have it all.“As someone who performs injectable facial fillers — who likes them and uses them myself — I believe the vaccine is safe,’’ she told me, “and the concept about worrying about how your face looks is not a reason not to get the vaccine.”</body>

	<title>She Said #MeToo. Now She’s Being Punished Under Defamation Law.</title>
	<author>Javier C. Hernández</author>
	<body>More than two years ago, He Qian, a former journalist in China, came forward with accusations of sexual assault against a well-known reporter. Her story circulated widely on the internet, helping give force to China’s burgeoning #MeToo movement.Now Ms. He, 32, is being punished for it. A Chinese court ruled this week that she had violated defamation laws by publicizing her accusations.She and a friend, Zou Sicong, who helped her share her story online, were ordered to pay more than $1,800 in legal fees and damages to the man whom Ms. He accused of assault, Deng Fei, a journalist at a Chinese magazine. Mr. Deng has denied the accusations.“Chinese law needs to do more to respond to #MeToo,” Ms. He, who also uses the first name Belinda, said in an interview. “This is only the beginning and far from enough.”Ms. He’s case has been a closely watched test of the Chinese government’s tolerance for the country’s small but spirited #MeToo movement. The decision by the court, in the eastern city of Hangzhou, highlights the challenges for women in China who come forward with accusations of sexual harassment and assault against prominent men.#MeToo has gained traction in China in recent years, despite the governing Communist Party’s strict limits on activism and dissent and its tight control of the internet. A number of prominent men at Chinese companies, religious institutions and universities have been forced to resign after women spoke out about harassment and abuse.But many obstacles remain. Rape and sexual harassment are often considered taboo subjects in China. The authorities often discourage women from filing complaints. And in recent years men accused of harassment have sued their accusers for defamation, in what critics say is an effort to intimidate and silence them.In her article, which circulated online in China after Mr. Zou published it on his social media account, Ms. He wrote about her time in 2009 as a 21-year-old intern at Phoenix Weekly, a Chinese magazine, where Mr. Deng was the chief journalist. She said that Mr. Deng invited her to a hotel room to discuss stories, then forcibly kissed and groped her.After the article was published, Mr. Deng sued both Ms. He and Mr. Zou for defamation.The court in Hangzhou sided with Mr. Deng, saying that Ms. He and Mr. Zou had not provided enough evidence of the alleged assault. “What they described lacks factual evidence and legal basis,” the court said.Ms. He and Mr. Zou said they would appeal the decision.Mr. Deng did not respond to a request for comment. “I’ve never done such a bad and stupid thing,” he wrote of Ms. He’s accusations in a recent social media post. He said he could not recall meeting her.Mr. Zou said Chinese law should be more responsive to women who bring forward allegations of assault and harassment.“Hoping a topic will just disappear and return to the old world is ignorant and peremptory,” he wrote on WeChat, a popular social media app. “I will take responsibility until the end for publishing the article about He Qian.”For activists eager to protect the rights of women and push back against China’s patriarchal culture, the decision was a setback.Feng Yuan, a co-founder of a women’s rights nonprofit group in Beijing, said the court had “completely denied the existence of sexual harassment.”“Many people will feel even more powerless in the face of sexual harassment,” Ms. Feng said.Despite the government’s efforts to limit activism, the #MeToo movement in China has had some success and continues to enjoy support among women from a variety of backgrounds.A court in Beijing last month heard the case of Zhou Xiaoxuan, a former intern at China’s state broadcaster who accused a prominent television personality, Zhu Jun, of sexual assault. (Mr. Zhu has denied the accusations.) Dozens of people gathered outside, some holding signs with the #MeToo hashtag, in a show of support that is rare at Chinese court proceedings.Despite the court’s decision, Ms. He said she would continue to press her case. She said she was encouraged that her case had prompted some discussion of women’s rights in China.“The worst-case scenario,” she said, “would be if no one discussed or paid attention to this topic and no one dared stand up.”Albee Zhang contributed research.</body>

	<title>The December Numbers Were Awful, but the Economy Has a Clear Path to Health</title>
	<author>Neil Irwin</author>
	<body>It seemed appropriate that the jobs numbers for the final months of 2020 would be as nasty as the year as a whole was.It is fair to say that the loss of 140,000 jobs in December indicates a backsliding of the economic recovery that took place in the summer and fall. Other numbers in Friday’s report confirm that basically gloomy picture, such as the continued depressed share of adults who are in the labor force. In the debate over which letter of the alphabet best describes the pattern of the 2020 economy, the December numbers pretty much rule out “V.”But. But.The details of this report, combined with everything else swirling around in economic policy and the financial markets, make for a more optimistic case. There is an opportunity for 2021 to be the year of a remarkable bounce-back, thanks to monetary and fiscal stimulus; the delayed effects of buoyant markets over the last few months; and above all the prospect of widespread coronavirus vaccination.The December numbers point to a jobs crisis that is contained to sectors dealing with the direct effects of pandemic-related shutdowns. Unlike the data from the spring of 2020, the latest numbers are not consistent with the sort of broad-based absence of demand in the economy that caused the recovery from the last few recessions to be so long and so slow.The steepest December job losses were in leisure and hospitality, a sector that shed 498,000 positions. Consider what that number represents: countless restaurants, hotels, and performance stages and arenas shuttered; and hundreds of thousands of people back on the jobless rolls and unsure when they’ll be able to resume work.The good news is we know how and when those jobs can come back. If enough Americans are vaccinated, they will probably feel comfortable in returning to normal patterns of leisure activity. An outright boom in those sectors is plausible later this year. Americans’ savings are through the roof, and it is easy to imagine pent-up demand for travel, concerts and the like.Other sectors less directly affected by public health concerns — industries that were at recessionary levels just a few months ago — kept improving. They are not necessarily back to pre-pandemic levels, but on track to get there before much longer.Construction employment, for example, is still 3 percent below its pre-pandemic levels, but the sector added 51,000 jobs in December. At that pace, it will be back to full health in the spring. The story is similar for manufacturing jobs, still down 4 percent from February but having added 38,000 positions in December.The list of sectors fitting that basic pattern — still at levels consistent with a recession but clawing their way back steadily — is long, and it includes industries as varied as truck transportation, real estate rental and leasing, and professional and business services.Both the policy and market environment should create tailwinds for those sectors in 2021, helping them return to full health faster.A booming stock market doesn’t translate into more economic activity overnight. But as corporate executives make their capital spending plans and as consumers make their spending decisions, surging stocks do tend to have a positive effect. That would imply that the positive effects of new market highs over recent weeks should start to show up as public health concerns recede.The December employment numbers cover a period before Congress reached a compromise pandemic aid package worth $900 billion. Among other things, the bill includes enhanced unemployment benefits that will help the hundreds of thousands of workers whose jobs disappeared in December, as well as $600 checks that should strengthen consumer spending in the months ahead.Moreover, the Democratic victories in Georgia this week and the resulting Senate majority make it more likely that those checks will grow to $2,000 per person. It also means that the Biden administration will have the flexibility to undertake a more ambitious agenda, including infrastructure spending, that should support overall economic activity.A Democratic Congress will also be likely to provide more aid to states, helping one of the other areas of job loss in December besides leisure and hospitality (state and local governments cut 51,000 jobs last month).Plenty could still go wrong, like a prolonged bungling of the vaccine rollout or a market correction that damages business and consumer confidence. And none of this diminishes the pain of the millions of Americans who are still out of work.But put it all together, and more so than at any point since the start of the pandemic, the economy has a clear path back to full health.</body>

	<title>Running Out the Clock on Trump Is Cowardly and Dangerous</title>
	<author>Jamelle Bouie</author>
	<body>The most shocking thing about Wednesday’s assault on the Capitol is that it happened. A mob of Trump supporters, some of them armed, stormed and vandalized both chambers of Congress, sending duly-elected lawmakers into hiding and interrupting the peaceful transition of power from one administration to the next.That this was whipped up by the president — “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women and we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them” — makes it an actual attack on the separation of powers: an attempt, by the executive, to subvert the legislature by force and undermine the foundation of constitutional government.Nearly as shocking as the attack itself has been the response from Congress. On Wednesday night, its members resumed their count of the electoral vote and certified Joe Biden as the next president of the United States. So far so good. But then they adjourned into recess. It was Thursday afternoon before the Democratic leadership — Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the soon-to-be Senate Majority leader, Chuck Schumer — called for the president’s removal. And even then, they urged the vice president, Mike Pence, to use the 25th Amendment to do it, with impeachment as a backstop.This is backward. A physical attack on Congress by violent Trump supporters egged on by the president demands a direct response from Congress itself. Impeachment and conviction is that response. To rely on the executive branch to get Trump out of the White House is to abdicate the legislature’s constitutional responsibility to check presidential lawbreaking.There’s also the question of those members of Congress, like Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri, who helped bring the president’s mob into fruition by backing the effort to contest and overturn the electoral vote, an effort they carried on even after the Capitol was breached and terrorized Wednesday. Even if it’s just a motion to censure, Congress needs to act.The alternative — to go slow, or worse, to take no action at all — will only create a sense of impunity. And American history offers ample evidence of how impunity in the face of mob violence can lead to something much worse than the chaos and mayhem on Wednesday. As it is, five people have died as a direct result of the mob attack on the Capitol.On Sept. 14, 1874, more than 3,500 members of the White League — a paramilitary force of ex-Confederates and Democratic partisans — seized control of the Louisiana state house in New Orleans, as well as the city hall and the arsenal. They aimed to depose Gov. William Pitt Kellogg, a Republican, and install his Democratic opponent from the previous election in 1872.It almost worked. White Leaguers overwhelmed an opposing force of Black state militia (led by James Longstreet, a Confederate general turned staunch supporter of the state’s Reconstruction government), took control of the city and even held an inauguration for the man, John McEnery, who would lead a “redeemed” Louisiana. Within days, however, news of the coup reached Washington, where an enraged President Ulysses S. Grant ordered troops to New Orleans. Rather than fight a pitched battle for control of the city, the White League surrendered, allowing Kellogg to return as governor shortly thereafter.There was no punishment for the men who planned this attempted coup. So there was no reason not to try again. After the 1876 election, the White League seized New Orleans for a second time, ensuring victory for Francis T. Nicholls, the Democratic candidate for governor, and effectively ending Reconstruction in the state.Just as important, the White League became a model for others in the South who sought an end to “Negro rule” in their states. In 1875, “White-Line” Democrats in Mississippi began a campaign of terror ahead of an election for state treasurer. They targeted Republican officials for assassination, sparked riots where Black citizens were beaten and killed, and sent armed vigilantes to break up campaign meetings and drive Black voters away from the polls. “Carry the election peaceably if we can,” declared one Democratic newspaper editor in the state, “forcibly if we must.”The next year, in South Carolina, white Democrats used a similar approach — violence, fraud and intimidation — to “redeem” the state from Republican control and to try to deliver its electoral votes to Samuel Tilden, the Democratic nominee for president.The toppling of Reconstruction was not the inevitable result of white racism. It was contingent on any number of factors, with uncontrolled violence near the top of the list. The vigilantes and paramilitaries — the White Leagues and Red shirts — operated with virtual impunity as they beat, killed and terrorized Black voters and their Republican allies. They demonstrated, again and again, that the state was weak and could be challenged and taken.Despite its violence, the mob on Wednesday was, in many respects, very silly. Once inside the Capitol, they took selfies with police and posed for photos with each other. There were livestreams and a few people even wore costumes. They also took the time to grab souvenirs; a podium here, a letter from the Speaker’s office there. It was a big game, a lark.But a lark can still have serious consequences. This particular mob successfully breached the Capitol in an effort, however inchoate, to install Donald Trump as president for a second time, against the will of the majority of voters and their electors. The mob failed to change the outcome of the election, but it showed the world what was possible. If the mob and its enablers — the president and his allies — walk away unpunished, then the mob will return.Again, five people are dead who were alive when Wednesday began. Next time, it might be dozens. Or hundreds. Next time, our government might not bounce back so easily. Here, Congress doesn’t need courage. It just needs a sense of self-preservation.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles.

	<title>Before They Wed, They Dated in Bahia, Dublin, Bangkok, Cape Town and Tulum</title>
	<author>Alix Wall</author>
	<body>In September 2016, Renate Hartman attended the Association for Women’s Rights in Development International Forum conference in Bahia, Brazil. Also called “Feminist Futures,” it drew 2,000 people from around the world working for women’s and L.G.B.T.Q. rights.As Ms. Hartman,50, a manager of international projects at COC Nederland, a Dutch L.G.B.T.I. advocacy group, entered a massive, crowded room, she felt relief when she spotted a Nigerian activist friend. She led Ms. Hartman to a table with her friends. One of them was Melinda Michels, 49, the director of the Emergency Assistance Program at Freedom House, a program in Washington that supports human rights defenders who are targeted by repressive governments.Ms. Michels, who goes by Mindy, was with a Canadian friend, and so Ms. Hartman, who lives in Amsterdam, thought she was also Canadian. Ms. Hartman was taken by her curly hair.The two spent some time together, and a couple of months later, they saw each other again at the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association world conference in Bangkok. While they felt a strong attraction at both gatherings, Ms. Hartman was up front with Ms. Michels about already having a partner, though that relationship was rocky. Their budding friendship remained platonic.After Ms. Hartman returned from Bangkok, she and her partner broke up.In January 2017, Ms. Michels and Ms. Hartman met in Dublin on a planned trip.“I’m crossing the Atlantic to meet someone I haven’t even kissed,” Ms. Michels told her friends. “They all thought, ‘This could go so horribly wrong.’”In fact, the opposite happened.“We laugh so much together,” Ms. Michels said. “Plus, at this stage of life you just know what works for you and what doesn’t.”“Of course, there are the irritations and frustrations,” Ms. Hartman said, “but we manage to work through them and things don’t escalate. We’re able to talk them out and get on the same page again without too much effort.”Each has a son from a previous relationship, and both boys love each other, Ms. Hartman said, despite the fact that her son, Stijn, 10, hasn’t begun learning English yet.Marriage wasn’t in their immediate future, since Ms. Michels was only going to move to Amsterdam after her son, Levi, 15, finished high school.Their last pre-pandemic visit in Amsterdam was in February 2020, for Ms. Hartman’s 50th birthday, and then the world shut down. While they hadn’t gone more than two months without a visit, they suddenly couldn’t see each other for five months, as now both were not allowed in each other’s country.After extensive research, Ms. Michels found that Turkey would allow them both in, so in July 2020, they stayed in a villa in Turunc, on the southern coast. Ms. Hartman overcame her desire to wait for a wedding with friends and family, and proposed to Ms. Michels there by memorizing a poem by Audre Lorde, a favorite poet of Ms. Michels.In July 2020, the Netherlands created a special visa for partners of Dutch nationals from other countries to enter during the coronavirus pandemic. In October, Ms. Michels went to Amsterdam, where she has been since, working remotely. In a document Ms. Michels compiled to prove their relationship, she counted 28 individual visits and trips they’ve made together, to destinations such as Tulum, Mexico, Cape Town and Oslo.They were married Dec. 11, by Maria Geus, a civil registrar at Stadsloket West, a municipal branch of city government in Amsterdam, with both their sons present. (It was possible for Levi to attend since he attends an international school in Geneva.)“Covid has made having a legal family relationship important to us,” Ms. Michels said. “We don’t want to ever be in the position again where we can be prevented from seeing each other.”</body>

	<title>How to Ensure This Never Happens Again</title>
	<author>Emily Bazelon</author>
	<body>The path from the Nov. 3 election has been harrowing for American democracy. Though state and local officials ran clean, well-functioning elections, leaving no doubt that Joe Biden was the victor, President Trump and a sizable faction of Republicans in Congress have relentlessly tried to subvert the results. Their assault culminated in Wednesday’s insurrection at the Capitol, a physical attack on the home of our democracy, incited by the sitting president.This dark reality owes much to Trump’s malign political style — his narcissism and demagogy, his willingness to sell lies to his political base — and to the ways that the Republican Party has fed his worst tendencies. But certain aspects of the electoral system also helped bring us to this point. With even the soon-to-be Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, now conceding that elections are not supposed to look like this, the months ahead may present a once-in-a-generation opportunity to fix what’s wrong with American democracy — or risk losing it altogether.Generally speaking, politicians don’t like to run on a platform of small “d” democratic reforms. Structural change can seem abstract and the obstacles to success too great. But history shows that it can — and must — be done. In other fraught moments, under pressure from an outraged American public, politicians have managed to transcend party and regional divisions to strengthen the democratic process.During the Progressive Era, Congress and the states approved two constitutional amendments that changed the nature of national elections. The first, ratified in 1913, allowed Americans to vote directly for their senators rather than leaving the choice to their state legislatures. The second was the 1920 women's suffrage amendment, which roughly doubled the size of the electorate.By the 1960s, the civil rights movement finally forced Congress, with the 1965 Voting Rights Act, to end the exclusion of most Black people from voting. A few years later, both parties reformed their primary systems to give their voters a real say in choosing their party’s presidential candidate. And in 1971, it took the states less than four months to ratify a constitutional amendment lowering the voting age from 21 to 18 in response to widespread protests over the Vietnam draft, which called up men starting at age 18.Since then, bipartisan majorities in Congress have passed more technocratic but still useful reforms. The 1993 National Voter Registration Act (also known as the motor voter law) required states to offer voter registration materials to people who get or renew a driver’s license or apply for public assistance. The Help America Vote Act of 2002 addressed meltdowns in the 2000 election — when an estimated four to six million ballots were not counted — by providing federal funds to replace faulty punch-card and lever-based balloting.Now we are once more in dire need of reform. But some proposals will be far easier to enact than others, and each will require a different strategy. Here are some ideas for fixing what ails, from the most feasible in the short run to the biggest reach.Fix the Electoral College ProcessThe 1887 Electoral Count Act, which is supposed to govern the resolution of a disputed presidential election, is “impenetrable or, at the very least, indeterminate,” according to Edward B. Foley, a scholar who has spent his career studying it. If we’re stuck with the Electoral College, we should at least make the rules for how it operates in the event of a dispute crystal clear.Congress could detail narrow circumstances in which a state election would be deemed to have failed (in the event of a natural disaster on Election Day, for example). A new law could also clarify that state legislatures have the power to choose electors only in those circumstances or not at all (the Constitution leaves the door open to more meddling). And it could outline what happens if a state submits dueling slates of electors, along with the current rules for choosing a president in the House if all else fails.Establish national best practices for voting and election securityAmerican elections don’t follow a set of best practices to enhance both access and security. Better election laws could provide for equitable access to polling places, early voting, and vote by mail, while protecting eligible voters from being purged from the rolls and ensuring that no one could vote twice. States could also build infrastructure that’s safe from hackers.Legislation in the House provides one possible blueprint. A bill it passed in 2019 would set national standards and fund election infrastructure. It also would grant the right to vote to people who have been convicted of a felony if they’ve been sentenced only to probation or released from custody (several states have since introduced their own such laws). And it sets up a pilot program to give high school students information about registering to vote before they graduate.Register voters automaticallyAutomatically registering voters — through drivers licenses, for instance — would add up to 50 million people to the rolls, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. When the House passed national automatic voter registration in 2019, no Republicans voted for it. If national legislation proves unlikely, states can enact automatic voter registration on their own. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have some version, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.Turn D.C. and Puerto Rico into statesThe Senate’s structure, with each state, regardless of population, having two senators, favors rural, white, Republican-leaning states, creating a body that fails to reflect the national electorate. Diverse, blue-leaning California, with almost 40 million residents, has just two senators, while the states of South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, Idaho and Alaska — all red-leaning and mostly white — have a combined 10 senators for fewer than five million residents overall. Statehood for the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico would not only provide representation in the national government to millions of Americans who now lack it, but would begin to address (though not eliminate) the imbalance in the Senate by adding four new Senate seats representing racially diverse, densely populated urban areas.The Democratic House passed a statehood bill for Washington for the first time last year. Statehood itself would require approval by both Congress and residents.End gerrymanderingPartisan gerrymandering reduces the number of competitive electoral districts, contributing to the polarization of Congress and state legislatures by pushing candidates away from the center and all but guaranteeing one party’s success in most races.In 2019, a conservative majority on the Supreme Court ruled that partisan gerrymandering claims are beyond the reach of federal courts. But state courts can limit gerrymandering based on state constitutions, as the Pennsylvania Supreme Court did in 2018. States can also adopt nonpartisan redistricting commissions, as several have done. Research shows that these commissions have succeeded in drawing electoral maps that neutralize partisan bias.Make People VoteCompulsory voting is, hands down, the most effective way to increase turnout. It also changes politics: Suppressing the vote is no longer a strategy. “Campaigns have to focus on persuasion, not demobilizing voters,” says Nathaniel Persily, co-director of the Stanford-M.I.T. Healthy Elections Project.A city or a county could pass an ordinance imposing a penalty on people who fail to vote. The idea wouldn’t be to force voters to pick a candidate. They could turn in a blank ballot. But they couldn’t ignore the election without some penalty. (A potentially more popular alternative — giving people a tax credit or another benefit in exchange for voting — would probably require a change in federal law.)Shorten the TransitionIn the early 1930s, in the midst of the Great Depression, Congress and the states came together on a constitutional amendment to shorten the presidential transition from four to two-and-a-half months. That change came too late to prevent a disastrous and lengthy transition between Herbert Hoover and Franklin Roosevelt, which accelerated the country’s banking crisis and deepened the depression. Now, the period from early November to Jan. 20 itself seems too long, given the fast-paced nature of political events. Rather than a time of peaceful transition, it has this year became an opportunity for mischief that can rattle democracy to its core. A new constitutional amendment could update the transition timeline, with no partisan implications.Eliminate the Electoral CollegeThe Electoral College, which apportions its electors based on the size of each state’s congressional delegation, skews elections by concentrating attention on a handful of swing states. One result is that a candidate can lose in the Electoral College while winning the popular vote. Ask Al Gore and Hillary Clinton.Eliminating the Electoral College altogether would require a constitutional amendment. As a more viable alternative, reformers have proposed a National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. States would pledge to award all of their Electoral College votes to the winner of the national popular vote. The compact would take effect once states with the winning minimum total of 270 votes join. So far, states with 196 electoral votes combined have signed on.Beverly Gage is a professor of history and American studies at Yale.

	<title>These Grooms Bonded Over Faith and Football</title>
	<author>Gabe Cohn</author>
	<body>One Monday in 2014, Christopher Justin Hanson sat down for a job interview at the headquarters of Covington &amp; Burling, a law firm in Washington. As the interviewer, who was stationed in front of windows overlooking Pennsylvania Avenue, thumbed through Mr. Hanson’s résumé, he noticed that Mr. Hanson didn’t have any experience in Washington. Mr. Hanson lived in Wisconsin at the time. Why, the interviewer asked, did Mr. Hanson want to start practicing in Washington?“Well,” Mr. Hanson said,  “I read in The New York Times that it’s the No. 1 place to live, if you’re a gay man, to meet people. That’s why I’m applying here.”It was a candid, nonchalant answer. Mr. Hanson remembered the hiring partner being “a little flabbergasted” by it — though, he added, “they definitely appreciated my frankness.”He got the job. Four years later, the location change paid off handsomely.When William Blake Hoffman, an architect and designer at Architecture, Incorporated in Reston, Va., matched with Mr. Hanson on Tinder in September 2018, he didn’t have grand visions of romance. Mr. Hoffman had moved to Washington a couple of years earlier, for what he intended to be only a few years. He didn’t plan to plant roots. So he suggested to Mr. Hanson that they meet for a drink at a beer garden located right on Mr. Hoffman’s way home from work. It was a Wednesday night.“I literally thought it was going to be a two-drink ‘hi, nice to meet you,’ like so many other dates,” Mr. Hoffman said.Mr. Hoffman was talking on his cellphone when Mr. Hanson arrived. He kept talking on the phone after Mr. Hanson sat down. Five minutes went by. Then 10. Mr. Hoffman was still on the phone. Mr. Hanson waited.In other circumstances, this cellular prelude might have been interpreted as a slight. But as Mr. Hanson listened to Mr. Hoffman’s call, he was able to decipher some useful, promising details: Mr. Hoffman was on the phone with his parents (which Mr. Hanson interpreted as a sign that Mr. Hoffman made family a priority) and, judging by their discussion of a Clemson University football game, he was a collegiate football devotee (so was Mr. Hanson).After almost 15 minutes, Mr. Hoffman hung up. As the two began talking, they were surprised to discover another similarity: They’re both Presbyterian. Neither had included that information in their Tinder profiles.“You don’t meet a lot of people in D.C. — especially young people — that speak openly about their faith,” Mr. Hanson said. “So that was just incredibly shocking for both of us to find that commonality.”They talked until around midnight. Mr. Hanson invited Mr. Hoffman to Sunday service at the Georgetown Presbyterian Church a couple of weeks later.So began a string of months spent bonding over faith and football. Mr. Hoffman brought Mr. Hanson up to speed on his alma mater’s team, the Clemson Tigers. Mr. Hanson did the same, getting Mr. Hoffman acquainted with the Yale and Harvard football teams. (Mr. Hanson, a graduate of both universities, can be seen briefly during ESPN2’s broadcast of the 2018 Harvard-Yale football game, dancing enthusiastically next to a seated, mildly embarrassed Mr. Hoffman.)Mr. Hoffman’s plans to leave Washington evaporated. He and Mr. Hanson became members of Georgetown Presbyterian. By the end of 2019, they were engaged.On Dec. 12, 2020, Mr. Hanson, 38, and Mr. Hoffman, 33, were married by the Rev. Dr. Camille Cook at the Georgetown Presbyterian.The day was momentous for both the newlyweds and the church: Mr. Hanson and Mr. Hoffman’s wedding was the church’s first for a same-sex couple since its founding in 1780. It was only after they began making preparations for the wedding that Mr. Hanson and Mr. Hoffman were informed of that.“The pastor brought it up and said, ‘Hey, F.Y.I., this has never happened here,’” Mr. Hoffman said.He and Mr. Hanson were surprised, they said, because there are other out members of the church, and because same-sex marriage has been legal in Washington for more than a decade.They were nonchalant about the pioneering nature of their wedding. “That 100 percent was not important to us,” Mr. Hoffman said. “But it was a fascinating little tidbit to learn.”</body>

	<title>Is Graphic Design the C.I.A.’s Passion?</title>
	<author>Ezra Marcus</author>
	<body>This week, the Central Intelligence Agency unveiled a new design for its website, CIA.gov, which wouldn’t have been news if the site had stuck to the formal signifiers of government authority: dense bureaucratic text, link directories, declarative headers, nothing too fancy.Instead, CIA.gov is set against a stark black background, offset by dots and lines that form topographical contours. There are subtle hallmarks of modern web design, like the site’s animated scroll. The crisp lines and muted color palette suggest a minimalist branding strategy. On social media, people noted the website’s visual similarity to electronic music festival fliers and streaming platforms like Boiler Room. Others compared it to the look of The Intercept, an online publication known for its reporting on the C.I.A., as well as marketing materials for brands like Urban Outfitters.“C.I.A’s mission is unlike any other, and our website reflects it. With CIA.gov’s black-and-white color scheme, photography and graphics, we want to pique the interest of talented applicants and provide a modern, relatable experience,” said Nicole De Haay, a spokeswoman for the agency, in a phone interview.Much of the conversation on social media revolved around the tension between the C.I.A.’s role in American security and the website’s trendy graphical cues.“If I didn’t read the copy, I wouldn’t know if this was for a direct-to-consumer designer toothbrush or an organization that’s been accused of destabilizing governments worldwide,” said Eric Hu, a freelance creative director who served previously as a design director at Nike Sportswear.Regardless of whether the C.I.A.’s mood board actually included 2010s electronic music culture, Mr. Hu agreed with those who noticed visual similarities. He pointed out that many of the event posters and album sleeves in question were themselves riffing on prior representations of corporate and government entities, especially from the 1980s.“Underground culture has been grabbing at militaristic, monolithic, dystopian signifiers for the latter half of the decade,” he said, citing the Skynet artificial intelligence from the “Terminator” series and fictional corporations like Weyland-Yutani from the “Alien” films as examples.“Objectively, it’s really funny that the C.I.A. has used a visual language that used to be considered evil and dystopian, and that’s since been kind of pacified,” Mr. Hu said. “It just seems like this full circle, ouroboros kind of thing, where it’s like, club culture kids took an evil aesthetic and made it cool.”Mr. Hu pointed out that the C.I.A. is no stranger to the tactical use of aesthetics; during the Cold War, the agency reportedly funded avant-garde American painters like Jackson Pollock in order to draw a contrast to the stifling intellectual atmosphere of the Soviet Union.Ultimately, he said, the C.I.A. rebrand revealed the futility in trying to use graphic design as a marker of political ideology. “It’s just a reminder that you shouldn’t look at something and say, like, ‘That is a liberal font and that is a conservative font,’” he said. “Everything’s been deterritorialized.”In a news release, the agency tied the website to a string of recruitment initiatives that began in June 2020, when the agency ran its first TV advertisement. The new site, which directs to the C.I.A.’s careers page, features photographs of diverse young people and their testimonials.“We’ve come a long way since I applied by simply mailing a letter marked ‘CIA, Washington, D.C.,’” said Gina Haspel, the C.I.A. director, in the release. The website’s high-tech look and focus on recruitment also underscores that the C.I.A. is competing for talent with Silicon Valley. “The website looked like a digital advertising agency website,” Mr. Hu said.The C.I.A. declined to comment on who created the website. Shortly after it was revealed, the conceptual artist and graphic designer Ryder Ripps — known for work with brands like Soylent and Pornhub, and musicians including Kanye West, Pop Smoke and Grimes — claimed credit on an Instagram page he uses as a digital portfolio. It was a troll, and it worked; the comments section of his post overflowed with sarcastic retorts. “Didn’t know there was a Squarespace template for imperialist coups,” one person wrote.“Platforms online are games played through the attention economy — authorship and sincerity is murky as it is,” Mr. Ripps wrote in an email when asked what inspired his post. “People were already living a fantasy before I posted it, saying that I had made the CIA branding, why not take their fantasy further and say I made it?”“I think its cool that they were so inspired by the Soylent branding I did in 2013,” he added, jokingly.In addition to riffing on the design, Mr. Ripps had some criticism to offer.“I think it’s pretty bad,” he wrote, “mostly because it’s looking from the inside to the outside of design — referencing ‘cool’ design of today (maybe actually a few years ago), all the while the government (and CIA) already has a very strong Federal design language. It probably could have used some tweaking for an update.”</body>

	<title>Ranks of the long-term jobless are bigger than the numbers show.</title>
	<author>Ben Casselman</author>
	<body>When the economy shut down last spring, many workers thought they would be out of a job for a few weeks, maybe a couple of months.Nine months later, many still aren’t back on the job.The Labor Department’s monthly jobs report on Friday showed that nearly four million Americans had been out of work for more than six months, economists’ standard threshold for long-term unemployment. That was up by 27,000 from November, and roughly quadruple the number before the pandemic began.Those figures almost certainly understate the scope of the problem. People who aren’t looking for work, whether because they don’t believe jobs are available or because they are caring for children or other family members, aren’t counted as unemployed.When the data was collected in mid-December, many of the long-term jobless faced a frightening deadline: Federal programs that extended unemployment benefits beyond their standard six-month limit were set to expire at the end of the year. The aid package later passed by Congress and signed by President Trump extended the programs, but by less than three months.Long-term joblessness was a defining feature of the last recession a decade ago, when millions eventually gave up looking for work, in some cases permanently. If that pattern repeats, it could have long-term consequences, particularly for people with disabilities, criminal records or other characteristics that make it hard to find jobs even in the best of times.“These are the kinds of workers who are really only recruited and called upon in a very tight labor market, and it may take us a long time to get back there,” said Julia Pollak, a labor economist with the hiring site ZipRecruiter. “That is the worry, that there are these groups of people who will drop out now and who will only really find good opportunities again after a sustained and lengthy expansion.”</body>

	<title>In 177 Portraits, an Artist’s Homage to His Bed-Stuy Muse</title>
	<author>Siddhartha Mitter</author>
	<body>Growing up in Bedford-Stuyvesant in the 1980s, the artist Kambui Olujimi had a fulfilled childhood in the span of a single block, on Quincy Street.Families shared cultural roots in the South and the Caribbean. The children played together, clustering by age, using the biggest tree on the block as home base for games of hot-peas-and-butter and freeze tag. Parents kept an eye on all the kids.Bed-Stuy in those days was a patchwork, Mr. Olujimi recalled. Some blocks were derelict and dangerous. But Quincy Street between Patchen Avenue and Malcolm X Boulevard was the other kind: vibrant with family and community life.“This block was tight,” Mr. Olujimi said. “This was a block.”Mr. Olujimi’s work is eclectic — spanning sculpture, installation, drawing, photography, video — but it often addresses collective memory and how it blurs or gets erased.For the last six years, he has turned that attention to the block that forged him, where he spent most of his childhood and then returned for 20 years of adult life, until 2015. His tribute to the block takes the form of repeated portraits of a single person at its core: Catherine Arline, the longtime block president universally known as “Ms. Arline,” who died in 2014 at age 77.“Walk With Me,” his series of 177 portraits, all painted in ink on 11 x 14-inch paper, is now on view at the nonprofit Project for Empty Space, in Newark, and in an online tour. Based on a single source image — a photograph of Ms. Arline at age 18, when she was newly arrived in New York City from North Carolina — they are at once uniform and endlessly varied.Initiated in grief, the series is a mourning practice that has carried Mr. Olujimi through the political and social turmoil of the last few years, opening new artistic directions for him. But it is also an experiment in memory work — an effort to convey something of the soul of a local community, through repetition and variations on an icon.On a bright afternoon in the fall, Mr. Olujimi, who is 44 and now lives in Queens, paid a visit to the block. Tall and lanky, he cut a sharp figure as he strolled, wearing an indigo-and-white coat of his design. Old folks, pleased to see him, chatted away from their stoops. A young woman walking to her car crossed the street to hug him and exchange family updates.“There’s a whole geography based on who used to live here,” he said.In front of one house, he remembered how the Dobermans got out once, causing “pandemonium for the under-10 set.” He recalled the man who drove elders to visit relatives down South in his van, the man who distributed the fish he caught to his neighbors, and a long roster of childhood friends, with nicknames and notable incidents.As he mapped the stories to houses, he seemed surprised at his recall. “I thought I was only going to be able to point out four or five,” he said. “It’s like I didn’t really go nowhere.”In the well-upholstered parlor of the Rev. J.T. Mitchell’s house, Mr. Olujimi and the pastor, another mainstay, whose church, Holy Trinity Universal, is also on the block, reminisced about Ms. Arline’s presence in this community.A social worker for the city by day, she ran the block association, turned an empty lot into a community garden, organized permits for block parties and collections for families in need. She led a liaison committee with the police precinct, buttonholed elected officials, and drove around in her burgundy Buick Skylark, endlessly energetic.“She wore many hats,” Rev. Mitchell said. “Up early, sleep late, even after she retired we had to make her sit down and get some rest.” Since her death, he said, “our block hasn’t been the same, and it won’t be the same.”That role — unsung, undefined — ensured the block’s cohesion, Mr. Olujimi said. “You saw Ms. Arline making sure we’re not going to skip over anything.” Without someone like her to initiate and follow through on projects, he added, “it’s not going to do itself.”Mr. Olujimi grew especially close to Ms. Arline after he became her tenant, when he moved into her building as a 19-year-old college dropout. “She had a belief in who I would be,” he said. He remained her tenant until she passed away.Their bond — people wondered if he was her son, he said — bolstered him as he completed his studies, worked as a freelance photographer, and built an art career. After she died from a heart attack, making portraits, he said, was his only way through the grief.“I’d wake up and start crying,” he said. He had not worked in ink before; he drew solace from the new medium, and from the repetition. “It was quieting that I was just doing this one thing,” he said.Mr. Olujimi’s portrait series starts sober, the early entries often literal, in black or blue ink. But soon he was applying color washes, emphasizing traits, blurring others, doubling or tripling his subject’s likeness. With rich colors and deconstructive verve in the later portraits, the series recalls a jazz piece that improvises on a theme toward a raucous, polyphonal resolution.Only through this process, in his view, did “Walk With Me” become a representation of Ms. Arline — and of her community.“You may see someone a hundred times but they’re different everyday,” he said. “These works rely on multiple visits, duration, time, and often other people and their vantage points.” Aspects of Ms. Arline in the paintings reflect not only his own interactions, but the way others on the block spoke of her. The expression is the artist’s, but the memory is collective.The series functions as a form of civic remembrance. Jasmine Wahi, the co-director of Project for Empty Space, who curated the exhibition with Rebecca Jampol, called the series a kind of alternative monument. “What does it mean to create a monument for someone who is so impactful at a micro-community level?” Ms. Wahi said. “In examining multiples of a single person, the series speaks more than any statue could.”“Ms. Arline was herself a monument to memory,” said the artist Christopher Myers, a friend of Mr. Olujimi who met the subject many times. “She lived not only in the stories that she told of her own childhood and arriving in New York, but she also functioned as the memory of that community on Quincy Street. She is, in some ways, Kambui’s memory.”Ms. Arline also shaped Mr. Olujimi’s path as an artist. When he moved into her building, in 1996, it was a return to the block after several years on the move. During high school, he had gone to live with elder siblings, first in Boston and then on an American base in Germany; he started studies at Bard College, but was dissatisfied and dropped out.With her guidance — and below-market rent — he returned to school at Parsons, majoring in photography. Soon he was working with artists. He was director of photography on projects by Wangechi Mutu and Coco Fusco; he co-directed a 2005 stop-motion short, “Winter in America,” with Hank Willis Thomas, another friend. His first solo show came the next year.Ms. Arline was there. “She came to every show I had in New York,” he said. His interest in serial, durational work, he said, owed to her life lessons about patience.Others on Quincy Street helped the artist in practical ways. The man with the van helped ferry materials. The church offered space to hang works-in-progress. Rev. Mitchell said, “He represents us.”Mr. Olujimi earned his M.F.A. from Columbia University in 2013, and he has shown widely since, but he has not been embraced by the art market as many of his friends have — which may in part be the result of his temperament, in their view.“The world doesn’t know what to do with sincere Black men,” Mr. Thomas said. “ He’s brought that same spirit he learned on the block into everything he does — that if it’s not real, you don’t do it.”In his studio in Long Island City, Queens, a modest space up a narrow flight of stairs, Mr. Olujimi showed some work in progress, products of the pandemic year.A series of small-scale “Quarantine Paintings” addresses violence in Minneapolis and Kenosha, grave-digging at the Hart Island potter’s field, as well as grotesque doings of the Trump family.Larger, more majestic works use painting and collage to depict Black bodies in outer space, experiencing the liberation of weightlessness, against constellations and infinite dark skies, in a state of what he calls Black Rhapsody.The medium — ink, augmented by pigments that he mixes — is one he learned making his portraits of Ms. Arline. And the lines, the blurred and duplicated figures, the glint in their eyes, carry distinct echoes of that series.Years after her passing, she walks with him.“That was her gift to me as she left,” he said.</body>

	<title>Forget About a Gym. These People Pay Thousands for Personalized Workouts.</title>
	<author>Paul Sullivan</author>
	<body>In years past, a new gym membership at the start of a year was as predictable as a glass of champagne at midnight. But this is not a usual year, with a quarter of the health clubs in the country estimated to have closed in 2020, and a far larger percentage of clubs operating with limited capacity.Not everyone, though, is giving up on the equipment and the training. For those who can pay for all the amenities of a gym, and then some, there is an array of high-end and highly personalized options.Jim Curtis, the lead health coach at the Institute for Integrative Nutrition, a school that trains health coaches who work in the fitness industry, said all of his clients had been getting more coaching during the pandemic.“It’s a boom whether its virtual or in person for those people who can afford it,” Mr. Curtis said. “But with virtual, it’s almost better. You can spend more time with people. You can see their environment. And you don’t have to worry about commute time.”In many cases, the workouts, and the equipment that goes with at-home fitness, have sent fitness bills skyward.“I’m in for $31,000 a year based on my quick calculation,” said Nick Wooster, a fashion consultant who turned 60 during the pandemic. “For me, it’s a nonnegotiable. Plus, right now, I’m not doing a lot of other things.”His exercise budget includes several gym memberships, a trainer who checks in with him virtually and works with him outdoors, a nutritionist, an age management doctor and “tons of supplements.” He has also stocked his apartment with a pull-up bar, weights, an ab roller, a yoga mat, a TRX suspension system and a massage gun.“It’s so important to have the physical release,” he said. “I can work out in my apartment, should I have to.”But his spending seems like a bargain compared with what the former New York Giants wide receiver Victor Cruz pays each year. He estimated that he is paying $60,000 annually to stay in shape, though that is down from the $80,000 a year he was spending when he was playing football. (At least he has a Super Bowl ring for his past expenditures.)Mr. Cruz, 34, who works in television now, said he had grown accustomed to doing Zoom workouts in the living room of his New Jersey home, with his trainer Eric Rakofsky on the other end. He has also done yoga at home and has hired a chef to help him with his diet during the pandemic.“I do a lot of things in the modeling space,” he said. “It’s important for my body to look a certain way.”Fred Koo, who works in the jewelry business, spends $75,000 a year on his fitness, he said. He uses a personal trainer six times a week and takes four to six group exercise classes. He has his own wellness and nutrition coaches.“I do take my fitness very seriously,” he said. “There’s always a workout at 4 p.m., and the day revolves around that.”In the pandemic, he has leaned more on meeting his trainer and attending classes virtually, but he kept at it, even when he went home last year to South Korea. “When you train with your trainer six times a week, you’re like best friends and you’re always in communication,” he said.Mike Bell, who trains Mr. Wooster, has created an outdoor, Covid-safe gym in his 450-square-foot backyard to continue work with clients. “We build up a lot of momentum training,” he said. “So much of it is keeping that momentum going.”He charges $250 a session. For a day rate of $1,000, he travels to clients’ weekend homes to train them and then hangs out afterward.The money that has been lost by fitness clubs has been made up by entrepreneurial trainers who have figured out ways to connect with their clients directly.Jill Anzalone, a trainer who lives near Foxborough, Mass., had been the head coach at a high-end Orangetheory Fitness studio. But when it closed over the summer, she took her classes online through a fitness app called Moxie, which does all the work of connecting her and her clients. The company said trainers charged from $30 to over $200 for a session.“It’s like a Zoom class but all through Moxie,” she said. “They can choose if they want to see me. I like to be able to see them.”It doesn’t hurt that Ms. Anzalone is also keeping a larger share of what her clients pay. Now teaching six virtual classes a week with eight students in each, she earns what she did with the same number of classes with 39 students in a crowded studio.Other trainers are charging retainers to be on call for a select number of clients. Mr. Rakofsky, who trains Mr. Cruz, is a former Golden Gloves boxer who until recently worked out of the high-end Performix House gym. (It was known for charging $900 a month and screening prospective members, but closed in December because of pandemic restrictions.) He has a group of clients who pay him annual retainers — some as high as $100,000 a year — to manage their fitness needs.“I’ve done it for three or four years now, but it’s really jumped” this past year, Mr. Rakofsky said. “People want that priority, and they’re willing to pay for it.”He added that before the pandemic, going to people’s homes on weekdays wasn’t an efficient use of his time, nor was connecting with them virtually. He met with his clients mostly in the gym during the week or at their summer home on the weekends.“Now it’s an option,” he said. “They’re willing to pay a premium for me to come to their home.”For his retainer, Mr. Rakofsky is managing his clients’ full fitness and diet plans and spends up to two hours a day with them, either in person or virtually. He also still maintains a roster of clients who pay his hourly rate of $300.Both groups, he said, are more prepared for a winter of indoor, socially distanced exercise. “They’ve ordered the equipment and have the online platforms,” he said. “They’ve taken the necessary steps to be prepared.”The cost of that equipment is substantial. People have flocked to expensive at-home fitness products with a recorded or livestream component. Peloton, the company that sells a $2,000-plus spin bike and charges $39 a month for classes, may be the best known of them. It has reportedly doubled its sales during the pandemic.But it wasn’t alone. Liteboxer, which is to boxing what Peloton is to spinning, sped up completion of a boxing machine that uses 250 LED lights to direct a user through a boxing workout. The machine costs $1,495, in addition to a $29 monthly subscription fee for coaching.Seth Medalie, an avid golfer who owns a financial services firm, has generally worked out of his suburban Boston home since the pandemic. He bought a Liteboxer three months ago and has been using it to burn off stress at the end of most days.“Pre-pandemic, I worked out three times a week in my home gym,” Mr. Medalie said. “During the pandemic, since I’m at home and working out every day, I started to get bored with my workouts.”Now, he said, he looks forward to boxing after work. “When you get to dance around and punch something in the privacy of your own home, that’s kind of fun,” he said.What it means for gym rats once people are vaccinated is hard to say. Jenny Newbry, an actor and playwright in Portland, Ore., who also transcribes for the deaf, was used to working from home, but she had regular outlets to her gym or yoga studio. Now that she is working out with her instructors in her house, first through Zoom, now on Moxie, she’s not sure when or if she will go back to in-person classes.“Even if I go back to the gym, I’ll still do this at least part of the time,” she said. “It saves me a lot of time on commuting. It’s also good for me because sometimes I’m not great at time management.”Some things, of course, can’t be recreated virtually. “I used to actually give physical hugs to my yoga teacher after class,” Ms. Newbry said. “There is that aspect of community that isn’t possible virtually.”</body>

I think that removes a lot of the potential issues between players and teams and the league itself.”_________The Word of the Day and the quiz question have been provided by Vocabulary.com.

	<title>This Couple Had a Hurried Ceremony — and Then Brain Surgery</title>
	<author>Tammy La Gorce</author>
	<body>Darien Monk doesn’t wish a broken espresso machine on anybody, but once upon a time she wouldn’t have minded if the ones at the Coffee &amp; Tea Exchange in Chicago, where she works, were out of order a little more often.“I would see Shane every once in a while at the store, and I thought he was cute,” said Ms. Monk, 43, of Shane Gerdes, an espresso machine repair technician. They met in 2007, when he was hired to work at the company warehouse across town. Espresso emergencies happen only so often. Crushes sometimes can’t wait.So when Ms. Monk told a co-worker about her attraction to Mr. Gerdes, 42, he promptly invited them both to a local bar. Then he sat them down together and left. Sparks flew. Within a year, they were living together in a new Chicago apartment, where they let a dozen years pass without much talk of marriage. “I’m a little shy, and essentially it felt like we were married anyway,” Ms. Monk said.Mr. Gerdes was OK with that arrangement until the coronavirus pandemic hit. “When quarantine started, I just had this feeling that I wanted to protect Darien, to make her feel safe,” he said. Legalizing their relationship seemed a move in that direction. On Memorial Day 2020, he took her to the Lincoln Park Zoo, the site of what they consider their first official date in 2007, and proposed.“Shane had made a picnic,” Ms. Monk said. “Normally he doesn’t do any cooking besides frozen pizza, but he made us PB&amp;J sandwiches and borrowed all this picnic stuff from a neighbor. It was very sweet.” When he presented her with a ring on the picnic blanket and asked her to marry him, she said yes.Neither was in a hurry to set a wedding date. “I absolutely didn’t want to do anything until the virus was over,” Ms. Monk said. That would change Dec. 11, when Mr. Gerdes started feeling dizzy while at the warehouse fixing espresso machines. He fell to the floor in a seizure and was rushed to a hospital in Oak Park, Ill. Ms. Monk got a call from the ambulance. “I stood outside the hospital for hours, but they wouldn’t let me in because of Covid rules.”Within a day, doctors found a brain tumor. “I saw my X-ray,” Mr. Gerdes said. “The tumor was huge, on my memory lobe. When you see something like that and they tell you it’s growing inside your skull, it’s terrifying. I didn’t know whether I would live or die.” What he did know is he didn’t want to wait a minute longer to marry Ms. Monk.On the morning of Dec. 13, the day before his brain surgery was scheduled, he called her at home. “He woke me up,” she said. “He said, do you want to come down here and marry me?” She pulled a dress from her closet and hurried to Rush University Medical Center, where a team of nurses had assembled a makeshift wedding chapel, with flowers and a wedding cake, in the hallway of the neuroscience intensive care unit. Doug Schlesser, a minister through the Universal Life Church and the husband of a Rush nurse, married them before 20 cheering medical staffers.Mr. Gerdes, who made it through his surgery the next day and is awaiting further diagnosis, was elated to have pulled off the seat-of-the-pants wedding his caregivers were eager to orchestrate.“I know it sounds morbid, but I love Darien and I wanted her to have my 401(k) and every other legal right in case I died,” he said. “I look like Frankenstein now — you can see where they drilled my skull — but I’m strengthened. I’m in a scrum and I’m going to beat this thing. I want to be with Darien and see her hair grow gray.”</body>

	<title>Who Said Art Is Only for the One Percent?</title>
	<author>Blake Gopnik</author>
	<body>Somewhere around the fall of 1967, a couple of new-minted Ph.D.’s, feeding six kids on an income of something like $9,000, set out to decorate their modest house. They brought home a wall-filling banner by the Pop artist Roy Lichtenstein, which had a dotty seascape cut into its cloth. And a tabletop set of “soft” drums made of canvas, by his colleague-in-Pop Claes Oldenburg. Also, a colorful set of abstractions: Squares within squares by Josef Albers of the Bauhaus.Those Ph.D.’s were my parents, and I’m pretty sure my career as a critic has its roots in that art — art that we’d never have lived with but for an outfit called Multiples, Inc. During its decade-long heyday, in a space on Madison Avenue in New York, the company made and sold new kinds of art that invited something close to mass production, allowing prices that even some young academics could manage.Multiples, Inc., first opened its doors 55 years ago this winter. On Jan. 12, that birth is being celebrated in a show at the New York gallery of Marian Goodman, now one of the world’s leading dealers but first known as a founder of Multiples.The company was born in a spirit “close to the socialist idea that art should be accessible,” Ms. Goodman recalled a few years ago. She and her partners “felt that if young people could buy something really beautiful it could change the audience — an audience that had become elitist because the art was so expensive.”The high-end, high-octane market for contemporary art that we now take for granted had arisen less than a decade before Multiples, Inc., and in 1965 it could still seem a dubious development; a less exclusive and exclusionary alternative had instant appeal. “Artists who questioned the status of art as a luxury commodity embraced multiples as a more democratic art form,” reads a wall text at the Museum of Modern Art, whose recent expansion has made room for an entire gallery dedicated to “The Art of the Multiple.”Early on, the goal was to replace the handmade expressionism of the 1950s with work that explored the materials and mass production of the space age. For her very first multiples, Ms. Goodman got artists to work with sleek, industrial Plexiglas; even if those pieces only got released in a few dozen copies, that could be enough to make them close kin, conceptually, to plastic goods produced by the million.A brooch by Lichtenstein, bearing a woman’s face in his trademark spotty style, was actually issued by Multiples, Inc., at a price of just $25. Working with industrial goods made by others, by 1967 the company was offering up stacks of mirrored glass by Robert Smithson, the land art pioneer and, in 1968, space-shaping lengths of cord by the conceptual sculptor Fred Sandback.Within less than a decade, however, Multiples, Inc., had begun to lose steam. Its most ambitious projects had often lost money: The popular Pop ones, like Oldenburg’s drums or the Lichtenstein pin, cost at least as much to make as they sold for. By the ’80s, when Multiples was mostly reduced to publishing prints, the serious art market was becoming utterly driven by “top prices for unique works,” according to the Swiss curator Dieter Schwarz, who organized the Multiples show at Goodman. That market had — and has — mostly written off the middle-class clients that Multiples, Inc. was founded for.That hasn’t meant the absolute death of art produced in editions. Fine prints have always existed. Museum gift shops and certain galleries still offer modestly priced objects by artists as famous as Damien Hirst or Jeff Koons. But few of those objects carry the charge — aesthetic or social — that multiples did in the ’60s. Instead of commenting on our commercial culture, they can seem fully complicit with it. In 2012, the great curator Germano Celant, who died last year of Covid-19, closed a major essay on multiples by decrying the way they had lost their ideals, turning instead “into a sort of second or third fashion line of art.” At worst, a 21st-century multiple can be like the $5,000 road bike that a billionaire buys with pocket change, to go with the $500,000 Ferrari.More substantial multiples do still get made, in the full Goodman tradition, mostly as fund-raisers for innumerable good causes. Last year, the California Institute of the Arts near Los Angeles announced that it would be celebrating its 50th birthday, in 2021, by getting 50 impressive alumni to conceive multiples for CalArts to sell. Multiples have retained just enough of their “provocative and disorienting message,” as Celant’s essay put it, to make them a good fit for today’s progressive causes. But hived off into this separate, do-gooder corner, the multiple has lost some of the impact it had when it truly went head-to-head with the art world’s one-offs.Joseph Beuys, icon of Germany’s postwar avant-garde, billed his 600 multiples — including his famous felt suit — as central to the spread of his ideas about art, functioning like “an antenna which is standing somewhere and with which one stays in touch,” as he put it. Only a few multiplists have similar ambitions today.Tacita Dean, a leading British artist now based in Berlin, has always been a market contrarian: The slow-burn films that made her famous are only sold as reels of actual, archaic film. So, over the last nine months, her idea of “productive” time spent in lockdown included forging the signature of Christian Dotremont, a long-dead Belgian surrealist, on 100 facsimiles of a postcard he once sent. She ordered 100 letterpress copies of a business card once handed out by the abstractionist Piet Mondrian, then hand-corrected the address on each one to match a penciled correction on the prototype.For another multiple, she stamped the words “Stamp Out Stamping” onto 100 vintage index cards — once on the first card, twice on the second and so on until the last card was just about stamped out with stampings.Her pandemic total came to 50 different eccentric multiples, each remade 100 times, for a just-finished portfolio titled “Monet Hates Me.” (The title comes from Ms. Dean’s discovery of a scrap of French script by Claude Monet that seemed to spell out “hate Tacita.” It was one of several modest objects that the artist dug out during a year she spent in the archives of the Getty Research Institute in California; they became the sources for her pandemic multiples.)Ms. Dean hopes to have the whole box of goods priced at something like 150 euros (about $184) per object, with all 50 adding up to less than she might normally get for a single photo or drawing. Or about what my parents paid, in inflation-adjusted dollars, for their Lichtenstein banner.“I knew that I was sabotaging myself by working on something that would make me zero money,” she said in a recent phone interview. But her goal was to put an entire “exhibition in a box” within reach of the most modest museums and libraries — or households. Ms. Dean speaks of her pandemic project as “anti-fetishized,” and of its clear roots in the democratized multiples of Multiples, Inc.Those origins are even clearer in one of the most notable multiples of recent times, by the Danish artist Danh Vo. (He’s best known for his full-scale copy of the Statue of Liberty, shown in 250 separate parts.)Twelve years ago, Mr. Vo discovered a touching 1861 letter by a French missionary to his father, written in Vietnam as the priest awaited execution by the country’s anti-Catholic regime. Mr. Vo took that letter and had his own immigrant father copy it out in the fancy script he’d learned as a child in Vietnam. The two men then offered it for sale for 300 euros, or roughly $369 today, in as many handmade copies as the world wanted. Mr. Vo figures that, by now, his father has written out the letter almost 2,000 times.“If I contributed anything in the arts, it’s with this work,” said Mr. Vo on a call from his home outside Berlin, adding, “I even tell collectors, ‘Why would you buy anything else?’” The admittedly cryptic piece touches on faith and identity, artistic and manual labor, immigration and assimilation, East and West, colonized and colonizer.Mr. Vo sees the letter’s almost trivial price tag as adding conceptual heft to the piece. He laughs about copies of it that have come up in auctions, given that a new one can always be ordered for the original price — which, with inflation, actually amounts to a steady decline in real cost.“I wanted my best work to be the cheapest work,” said Mr. Vo. That’s a perfectly sensible statement that only seems strange because, in the years since the high-end market eclipsed Multiples, Inc., we’ve come to think that the best art always bears the biggest price tag.Multiples, Inc.: 1965-1992Opens Jan. 12 through Feb. 27, Marian Goodman Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, 212-977-7160; newyork@mariangoodman.com.

	<title>The Attraction Was Real. The Legislature Wasn’t.</title>
	<author>Gabe Cohn</author>
	<body>At around 5 a.m. one day in the fall of 2016, Olivia Alexandra Barket received an unexpected knock on the door of her Brooklyn apartment.The knock came at a particularly hectic time. Ms. Barket was working for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, as its deputy director of Federal Election Commission reporting. The election was around the corner, and the campaign was operating at its most frenzied pace yet. The night before, Ms. Barket had spoken on the phone with her boyfriend, Cory Max Yeffet, who was living and working in Washington. Ms. Barket knew she had sounded a little down, a little exhausted. She was working seven days a week.Mr. Yeffet heard the fatigue. So after the nighttime call, he packed a bag and boarded a bus to New York. He wanted to be there by morning, so Ms. Barket would have someone to wake up with before leaving for another grueling day of campaigning. By the time he got there, the sun was coming up. He hadn’t told Ms. Barket that he was coming.“Cory had literally gotten on the bus at 11 p.m.,” Ms. Barket said. “I don’t even have words for it. I’m still emotional just thinking about it.”Mr. Yeffet was in a good position to understand Ms. Barket’s political fervor: The couple first met in 2007 as high school students preparing for a mock session of congress.Mr. Yeffet was a 15-year-old high school sophomore, and had traveled to the University of Florida to take part in a national debate tournament. The students there were split into groups. He had sat down. Then, he recalled, a “beautiful and confident and poised” young woman walked in and took a seat next to him. The 15-year-old Ms. Barket was not as struck by Mr. Yeffet — she had a boyfriend.Ms. Barket and Mr. Yeffet spoke only briefly during that tournament. But because they were each involved with high school speech and debate — he at Dr. Michael M. Krop Senior High School in Miami, she at Trinity Preparatory School in Winter Park, Fla. — they crossed paths many times.“We would see each other at tournaments across the state and across the country from that point forward,” Mr. Yeffet said. When they were pitted against each other at a debate event later in high school, he said, she “beat me twice, which is no surprise to anyone.”The two became friendly acquaintances. That relationship remained after they both moved from high school to college at the University of Florida in 2010.Then one night during their junior year at the university, after a Kendrick Lamar concert on campus, she approached him at a pub. She had just been appointed chairwoman of the debate tournament that she and Mr. Yeffet had met at years before, and she wanted to ask advice on how the tournament might update its branding. They ended up talking at length. The next day, he asked Ms. Barket to lunch. Within two months, they were a couple.After they received their undergraduate degrees, in 2014, the two began an extended period of long distance. Ms. Barket left for a job in Washington. Mr. Yeffet stayed in Florida to get a graduate degree. After that, Mr. Yeffet got a job in Washington. But by the time he got there, Ms. Barket had relocated to Brooklyn to work for the Clinton campaign.In 2017, they were finally able to start living together in Florida — but only for a year. Mr. Yeffet had moved back for work; Ms. Barket started law school at the University of Miami, then the following year transferred to Harvard. By time Mr. Yeffet proposed, in 2019, the couple had only spent about a year total living in the same city, not counting college.Because of the remote work necessitated by the coronavirus pandemic, Ms. Barket has been able to work from Florida for most of 2020, and to be with Mr. Yeffet. She is now working as an election and political law associate at Covington &amp; Burling, a law firm based in Washington, but she is to begin a federal judicial clerkship in Florida in August. He is a director at Integra Investments, a real estate investment firm in Miami.Ms. Barket and Mr. Yeffet, both 28, were married Dec. 11 in a seaside service in Palm Beach, Fla. Rabbi Cheryl Jacobs performed the ceremony.Ms. Barket does not know yet whether she will have to return to Washington before her Florida clerkship begins. But if she does, both she and Mr. Yeffet feel prepared to enter a long-distance period again, if only briefly.“It becomes easier to do,” Ms. Barket said. “We’ve always been so committed to the other person’s dream.”</body>

	<title>How the Head of a Vaccine Research Clinic Spends Her Sundays</title>
	<author>Alix Strauss</author>
	<body>[Here’s how you can get the coronavirus vaccine in NYC.]As vaccination efforts ramp up around the city, Dr. Stephanie Sterling is well aware of the challenges ahead.“We’re going to need more than one or two vaccine options to get out of this pandemic,” said Dr. Sterling, the chief infectious disease and hospital epidemiologist at NYU Langone Health in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, and the head of its new vaccine research clinic. “We don’t know if one will have better long-term effects or work better in certain age groups or with certain populations, which is why we’re conducting our own trials.”The clinic continues to follow shifts or evolutions of viral strains, according to Dr. Sterling, who was vaccinated last month. “I had arm soreness, but that was it,” she said.Dr. Sterling, 45, lives with her husband, Bladimir Raúl Quijano Rondan, 46, also a doctor and an infectious disease fellow at NewYork-Presbyterian Queens Hospital, in a duplex on the Upper East Side of Manhattan with their cat, Gracie.GOO ALL AROUND Gracie, who wants to eat, wakes me up at 7:30 by walking all over me. I feed her and drink a syrupy sugar energy goo, put on biking clothes and then my husband and I go biking. We enter the park by the Guggenheim and hit the Harlem Hill. Only serious bikers are out, which is very humbling because we are not.COFFEE SNOB Back at the house we do some ab work. Sometimes Gracie jumps on me. That’s an extra eight pounds, which is really hard. I’m snobby with my coffee, which I make from my Moka Express stovetop machine with coffee sent from a friend’s coffee farm in Colombia, or a company out of Denmark, which is super fresh and yummy. We order omelets — sausage, apple and cheese — from Barking Dog, a local restaurant. I shower and dress, and by the time I’m done, the food has arrived. We eat together with European soccer playing on the TV because we’re huge soccer fans.THE COMMUTE Before leaving I log into the hospital’s medical hub to answer a list of questions, including where I’ve been in the last 24 hours, if I have a fever or other Covid-19-related symptoms. A text is sent to my phone with a green background; it’s a visual cue for security that says I’m OK. I’m out the door by 9. If my husband is on call he takes our Mazda CX-3, which is a great city car for potholes and parking. I’ll take the Q to the N or R or get more creative depending upon mishaps and weekend changes.THE OFFICE I’m at the hospital by 9:30. For the next several hours I’m at my desk. I’ve brought coffee with me for a second cup. If there are no emergency consults, my day is spent reviewing patient charts. We’ve learned a lot about how to treat Covid-19 patients and the importance of steroids and Remdesivir. Most of ours right now have acute Covid-19 pneumonia and we’re seeing less people admitted for weeks at a time in the I.C.U.ACROSS THE STREET I’ll go down to the cafeteria at 2 for soup, chili or veggies and hummus — it’s easy and quick. Then I walk across the street to our other building, which is where our vaccine distribution center is and where we are currently administering the Pfizer vaccine.AVOIDING A REPEAT All the vaccine trials have made a huge effort to enroll the minority population. Last spring, my hospital was full of nonwhite people gasping for breath and not doing well. We can’t repeat what happened in March and April. People who were barely able to breathe filled room after room. It was horrible. We’re still dealing with the trauma of having gone through it.THE VACCINATION Once someone receives the vaccine we’ll observe them for 30 minutes. We are doing several hundred a day. So far it’s been incredibly smooth and filled with lots of emotion by the staff. The people giving it are so excited to be part of helping keep fellow workers healthy. And the opportunity to be part of history. There’s a massive amount of pride.RESEARCH I go to our vaccine treatment and evaluation unit. NYU is one of 10 in the United States. We’re participating in clinical research for the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is different and cheaper than the Pfizer and Moderna options. Those trials needed massive enrollment, which we started doing in November with over 150 people, have not stopped and are ongoing. Over the next two years we will be following those participants closely. No one knowingly had Covid-19, that’s part of the requirement for the trial. If there’s a specimen that needs to be processed I go to the freezer, grab it and head back to the hospital and drop it off in the lab.PATIENTS I return to the hospital by the pedestrian bridge and start seeing I.C.U. and non-I.C.U. patients until 4 or 4:30. Before leaving for home I’ll go back to my desk and send messages to the teams if there’s anything crucial for them to work on.FUTBOL I feed the cat, then for the next 30 or 40 minutes I’ll relax and watch TV; usually it’s Spanish soccer. Then it’s back to work on the computer to input all my notes on my patients in our second bedroom, which is our office-now-turned-gym.COMFORT FOOD, NOTHING VIOLENT At 8:30 or 9 I step away to eat dinner with my husband. We have a really tiny kitchen. We work long hours and we’re both too tired to cook so we order in. We like Felice 83, which has good fresh pasta, or Mission Ceviche, which has pretty decent Peruvian food. I’ll have a glass of wine and eat in the living room. Unwinding usually involves knitting, I’m working on a sweater. Maybe we’ll watch a movie. During the worst part of the pandemic I couldn’t watch war movies or anything violent. I saw so much badness in the hospital. I couldn’t watch the news either. There was a lot of misinformation, which was frustrating. It’s better now, but I still can’t watch it.A LITTLE SCI-FI By midnight we’re both in bed. Bladimir falls asleep first. I read for 15 minutes to help relax. I’m rereading “Dune,” which I haven’t read in a long time. They’re coming out with a new version of the movie. In the mists of Covid-19 it was hard for me to read. I needed more mindless activity. I knew I was returning to myself once I started reading it again. Then it’s lights out.</body>

	<title>Protesters Given Prison Terms for Beating Reporter at Hong Kong Airport</title>
	<author>Vivian Wang</author>
	<body>HONG KONG — A Hong Kong court on Friday sentenced two men and one woman to several years in prison for assaulting a Chinese state media reporter during a protest that paralyzed the territory’s international airport in 2019.The sentences ranged from four years and three months to five and a half years — the heaviest penalties handed down yet in connection with the protest movement that engulfed Hong Kong that year, according to a lawyer for one of the defendants.The assault took place during a drawn-out occupation of the airport by antigovernment protesters in August 2019 that resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of flights and crippled one of the world’s busiest transit hubs for two days.As tensions rose between protesters, police officers and supporters of Hong Kong’s government, at least a dozen people surrounded Fu Guohao, a reporter for Global Times, a nationalistic tabloid owned by China’s ruling Communist Party, according to prosecutors.Mr. Fu, 29, claimed to be a tourist, but protesters were suspicious of his identity. They began punching and kicking him, and also bound him with zip ties and shined lights into his eyes, prosecutors said.The judge, Lee Hing-nin, said that CCTV and media footage of the incident proved the guilt of the three defendants: Lai Yun-long, 20; Amy Pat Wai-fan, 25; and Ho Ka-lok, 30. A fourth defendant was acquitted after Judge Lee said his role in the episode was not clear from videos.Judge Lee wrote in his ruling that the defendants had tried to “stimulate and provoke feelings of hatred” in the crowd toward Mr. Fu, and that they had prompted fears that they would inspire others to “destroy the peace of society.”The protests, which began in June 2019, were set off by a proposal to allow extraditions from Hong Kong, a former British colony that returned to Chinese control in 1997, to mainland China and other places. They soon evolved into broader demonstrations against the Chinese government, marked at times by fierce resentment and outright aggression toward anyone seen as affiliated with the mainland.Some demonstrators later apologized for their behavior during the airport protest. They said that the Hong Kong police’s use of undercover officers to infiltrate their ranks had made them fearful and suspicious.A defiant remark that Mr. Fu made to the protesters — “I support the Hong Kong police. You can all attack me now” — became a nationalist meme on China’s heavily censored internet, driven in part by Global Times and other state-run media outlets, which falsely depicted the protest movement as exclusively violent.The protests have since been quashed by both the pandemic and a sweeping national security law that Beijing imposed on Hong Kong last June, under which broad categories of dissent have been made illegal and numerous protesters, politicians and others have been arrested.Mr. Ho was sentenced on Friday to five years and six months in prison, Mr. Lai to five years and three months, and Ms. Pat to four years and three months. They were convicted of a mix of charges that included rioting, assault and unlawful imprisonment.Wong Sze Hai, a lawyer for Ms. Pat, said that to his knowledge, the sentences were the longest yet given in connection with the protests. Previously, a protester had been sentenced to four years.The Hong Kong police hailed the sentences. “The riots that occurred in such an important place not only hurt the victims, but also humiliated Hong Kong’s people,” Cheung Man Hon, a senior inspector, said at a news conference on Friday. “This sentence reflects the severity of the riot and will certainly have a deterrent effect.”Elsie Chen contributed research.</body>

	<title>The Road to This Wedding Was Paved With Theft, Lies, Tears, Other Marriages — and Forgiveness</title>
	<author>Alix Wall</author>
	<body>The lessons from the love story of Irene Sibaja and Hal Karp are many, but here are some of the more obvious: The old dating adage “right person, wrong time” is real; forgiveness is a gift; sharing your darkest moments can have a positive outcome; and looking for an ex online can sometimes be a good idea.Mr. Karp and Ms. Sibaja first met in 1993. Mr. Karp, who graduated from Southern Methodist University, had grown up in Denver and Dallas, the oldest of three children of David Karp and Renee Karp. Ms. Sibaja, from Houston, was the third of four children of Jane Root and the late Dr. Elihu Root. Ms. Sibaja graduated from Rice University and has an M.B.A. from Harvard, and was working in Dallas for Bain &amp; Company in strategy consulting.Mr. Karp was then a freelance writer and editor. He had organized an event, through a young adults’ group at Temple Emanu-El in Dallas, to update a playground he had designed a few years earlier for children with H.I.V. Ms. Sibaja went to volunteer. “She’s smart as all get-out and a go-getter, and is all-in whatever she’s into,” Mr. Karp said. “And she just lights up a room. Her laugh can be heard from a block away.”They fell for each other fast and began dating. In Ms. Sibaja, Mr. Karp saw a young woman who had her act together, in the way he aspired to. She saw a young man with a huge heart who wanted to make a difference in the world.But Ms. Sibaja, then 26, learned that Mr. Karp had another side, too. Mr. Karp, then 29, was addicted to both alcohol and drugs; cocaine was his drug of choice. While she was unaware of his addictions, they manifested in extreme mood swings.She had planned a one-year extended stay in Costa Rica to teach English before they began dating. Before she left, she lent him a credit card to finance a volunteer project. She had the statements sent to him so he could make the payments.They tried to make things work long distance but it was difficult. Mr. Karp visited her. “I knew he was struggling,” she said, “but I didn’t know the real reason.”After he returned from visiting her, she called him from Costa Rica and ended the relationship by phone.He was angry, especially at her, and was broke. Without her knowledge, he had obtained a second credit card in her name, and then a third. He charged more than $10,000.“You think you’ll pay it back and she’ll never find out,” he said. “As an addict, you rationalize the craziest things.”But Ms. Sibaja learned what he had done. She called from Costa Rica and confronted him by phone. She hung up on him, and then didn’t answer when he called her back multiple times.That night, he said he sat on the couch in the dark in his apartment, finally realizing the misery he had wrought. He could repay the bank for the credit card charges, but violating the trust of the woman he loved? He could never make up for that.“I was done,” he said. “There was this moment of surrender.”It was August 1994. He has been sober since.While bank officials were deciding how to handle Mr. Karp’s case, he began making regular payments on the charges and even provided his address and name of his employer. The bank ultimately decided not to press charges. His lawyer told him it was a miracle he didn’t serve time.He wanted to make amends to Ms. Sibaja right away, but the people guiding him made a suggestion: “You’ve already ruined this person’s life once; the best gift you can give her is to leave her alone.”After dating Mr. Karp, therapy helped Ms. Sibaja learn to trust again. She married in 1998 and had two children. Mr. Karp married, too, in 1999, and had a son.Each wondered about the other as the years passed.“I thought you don’t get that kind of love more than once in your life,” Ms. Sibaja said. “It’s not that I didn’t have love for my ex-husband, because I did, but it was just different.”Mr. Karp, too, said that Ms. Sibaja had set the highest bar possible; consciously or unconsciously, the women he met could never measure up to her.They each admitted to occasionally searching the other online. This was how, in 2018, now both divorced, Ms. Sibaja found Mr. Karp on Facebook. He had posted a link to “Unorthodox,” a Jewish podcast hosted by Tablet Magazine. For Yom Kippur, the Jewish holiday of atonement, the podcast has an annual apology episode, which that year featured Mr. Karp telling a story about how he was able to repair his relationship with his brother.Mr. Karp, who was the assistant producer and then producer of a storytelling event in Dallas called “Oral Fixation,” was used to encouraging participants to share their most vulnerable moments; now it was his turn. His story was about how, before he met Ms. Sibaja, he allowed his brother to be arrested in his stead when they got into a physical fight, fueled by his addiction. He told about how he was able to make amends by being his brother’s caregiver after he needed sudden surgery. He also mentioned there were others he had badly hurt.Ms. Sibaja knew he was talking about her. “You could just hear in his voice how sorry he was,” Ms. Sibaja said. “The courage it took to do that, it’s just so brave.”The fact that Ms. Sibaja might hear it never occurred to Mr. Karp.  He said he hoped that his story could give hope to someone else who may be struggling.“God says ‘here’s the deal,’ but then, later, I realize, ‘no, the deal is really much bigger than you think it is,’” he said.It was vulnerably sharing his darkest moments that prompted the woman he never stopped loving to reach out.Ms. Sibaja wrote to him on Facebook, saying she was glad he was in a much better place. She also gave a brief update about herself: she was divorced, living in Arkansas with her two children and their dog.Mr. Karp was stunned. If she ever came to Dallas, he wrote, he would like to make amends to her, too.Two months later, in November, 2018, they met at Café Brazil in Dallas, a place they used to frequent when they dated. The only thing on Mr. Karp’s mind was setting things right. “I was not the boyfriend you deserved,” he told her. “You deserved the best, not me.”But that wasn’t enough for Ms. Sibaja. She never thought she’d have this opportunity to ask him something she had wondered about all these years.“What was I to you?” she asked him in that moment. “Did I mean anything to you? You were the love of my life.”It was as if Mr. Karp had a “cry” button inside him, he said, and she had just pushed it, hard. He sobbed. “It just broke me to think she had thought all these years that she didn’t matter to me when she was all that mattered,” he said.Realizing just how much pain he had caused her had been the wake-up call he needed back in 1994 to quit drinking for good, he told her. His path to sobriety had started that next morning.They hugged when parting. Ms. Sibaja returned to her car and just sat there. The tears kept flowing. “Thank you for seeing me,” she messaged him from her car. “I’m not entirely sure how to navigate the reconnect.”They figured it out, quickly. They began texting and talking from that day on.Mr. Karp bought tickets to “Finding Neverland” in Little Rock, Ark., and reserved two hotel rooms; he knew that regaining her trust was going to take time. “Hamilton” in Chicago followed.Mr. Karp didn’t believe in long-distance relationships. But he also didn’t believe he was worthy of a second chance with Ms. Sibaja. Yet she had opened the door. They both said it was as if their hearts had come home, when they didn’t know there was such a thing.Ms. Sibaja feared her mother’s reaction. She didn’t tell her, at first, and Ms. Root was far from pleased when she found out. She then received a letter from Mr. Karp, asking if they could talk. Her first question: Why hadn’t he tried to make amends earlier? Ms. Root has a close friend who was also in recovery, who confirmed his explanation about the culture discouraging it.“Hal is one of the sweetest, most caring people I’ve ever met,” Ms. Root said, “and I really knew how much he loved her, and that he never stopped, despite what he had done to her.”A year later, Mr. Karp wanted to propose. Given the podcast’s role in reuniting them, Mr. Karp felt it should be involved as well. The hosts invited the couple to be guests at a live appearance they were doing in Cincinnati. “While we loved Hal’s story of suffering and redemption, the last thing we expected was that broadcasting it would help him refind love,” said Mark Oppenheimer, the host of “Unorthodox.” The proposal came without a live audience, though.A day after their engagement, in November 2019, Ms. Sibaja told the live audience, “Forgiveness is a gift, and it’s a choice. In the years in between, we’ve done so much work on ourselves and were in a place that this could happen. And not only that, but my mother who I was petrified of all people to tell, they now have the sweetest relationship, too.” In February 2020, Mr. Karp moved to Rogers, Ark., where the couple now live and Ms. Sibaja is a vice president of client service for Nielsen, the marketing research company. Mr. Karp, 57, has his own business helping teens prepare for college entrance exams and essay writing.Plans for a May 2020 wedding were postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. They then chose Ms. Sibaja’s 54th birthday, Dec. 6.They married 27 years after they met, in a small, socially distanced ceremony at Temple Emanu-El in Dallas, by its senior rabbi, David Stern, with the senior rabbi of Temple Shalom Dallas, Andrew Paley, participating. Each rabbi stood masked on either side of the huppah, while their 30 or so guests sat spaced apart and masked.In his vows, Mr. Karp reminded Ms. Sibaja how when they first reconnected, she had said his apology was a gift she never thought she would receive in this lifetime.“I was the one who got the gift I never thought I’d receive in this lifetime,” he said. “Your love.”When Dec. 6, 2020Where Temple Emanu-El, DallasAttire Ms. Sibaja wore yellow Converse Chuck Taylor sneakers chosen by her daughter, Tova, who wore matching ones, with her Allison Webb wedding gown. Ms. Sibaja’s late father was known as a natty dresser and to honor him, Mr. Karp, his son, Eli, and Ms. Sibaja’s son, Samuel, wore ties that had belonged to Dr. Root.The Podcast The three hosts of “Unorthodox” and its producer were given the honor of reading four of the seven blessings traditionally recited at a Jewish wedding. They did so from their homes on Zoom, projected onto screens in the sanctuary.The Reception With Covid-19 cases rising, nearly everyone participated virtually, while the couple, their children and a few close friends enjoyed a celebratory meal at the Kimpton Pittman Hotel. Guests were sent celebration boxes filled with a half bottle of prosecco, miniature champagne flutes, wedding cookies, a personalized bottle of hand sanitizer and accessories for photo-booth-style selfies at home.</body>

	<title>A start-up raises money in a bid to create business benchmarks for climate risk.</title>
	<author>Michael J. de la Merced</author>
	<body>As companies and regulators increasingly see climate change as a business threat, the data company Gro Intelligence is devising indexes that it says can track climate risks in a granular way — and could create a new class of financial investments.The company is developing indexes to measure conditions like drought, floods, temperature and more, according to Sara Menker, its founder and chief executive. For example, its software aggregates 46 variables into a single measure of drought severity on a scale from zero to five.These indexes, along with a new $85 million fund-raising round that Gro will announce on Friday, the DealBook newsletter reports, are the latest signs of the financial industry’s efforts to generate money from environmental initiatives.More investors are piling into climate-focused minded funds, like the one created by the investment group TPG that recently named Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary and Goldman Sachs chief executive, as executive chairman. (A partnership including TPG is one of the lead investors in Gro’s latest round.)A big opportunity lies in climate-linked financial products. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission recently published a report declaring climate change a systemic risk and urging the development of new financial hedges and investments. Data providers like S&amp;P Global have been promoting their ability to score companies on a variety of environmental factors.Gro also signed up a new board member: Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs president and Trump economic adviser, who was initially asked to find weak spots in Gro’s indexes. “Universally trusted and transparent data” is important as companies are required to disclose more about their climate risks, he said.Among Gro’s clients is Unilever, which already uses Gro’s data for sustainability planning at its Knorr brand. “Data driven insights are key to assessing and managing the risk of climate change on our food supply,” said Dorothy Shaver, who leads Knorr’s global sustainability efforts.Gro’s bigger ambition for its indexes is to encourage a new universe of financial instruments, like swaps that companies and investors can use to hedge climate risks, catastrophe bonds and even exchange-traded funds, said Ms. Menker, herself a former Morgan Stanley commodities trader.She said could not predict what else could be built on the indexes: “Our dream as a company is that you have many, many applications that come on top of Gro.”</body>

	<title>Rapid virus testing will ramp up inthe U.S., as F.D.A. approved three new at-home kits.</title>
	<author>Katherine J. Wu</author>
	<body>Amid surging coronavirus cases, the top U.S. testing official on Thursday announced another scale-up in the country’s diagnostic efforts, touting the importance of tests that can run from start to finish outside the lab.The government will allocate an additional $550 million to community-based testing programs across all 50 states, said Adm. Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health. The government will also put $300 million toward 60 million kits for federal distribution to nursing homes and other vulnerable communities.Dr. Giroir projected that the country’s capacity for non-laboratory testing could more than double by June.In a video livestream, Dr. Giroir held up three new at-home testing kits, designed by Ellume, Abbott and Lucira Health, that recently received emergency green lights from the Food and Drug Administration. All can deliver results in a matter of minutes after a quick nasal swab, though only Ellume’s product can be purchased without a prescription.The Abbott and Ellume tests search for bits of coronavirus proteins called antigens. Lucira’s test, like most laboratory-based tests, hunts for genetic material.Dr. Giroir, who will depart his position on Jan. 19 as part of the transition to the Biden administration, praised the tests as “sophisticated” but cautioned that none were yet in widespread use. Production ramp-ups are in progress, he noted, but might not alter the market for a few months.Ellume’s test, for example, while it will be sold over the counter in a few weeks, will still be available in only very limited quantities.Experts have repeatedly cautioned that rapid tests are not as accurate or consistent as tests that route people’s samples through a laboratory, where they are typically processed with a technique called polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R.Rapid tests, which can run from start to finish in a matter of minutes, may also falter more often when used on people without symptoms. Even so, they are often used — as a way to frequently screen some populations like nursing home residents and schoolchildren. But rapid tests typically have cost and convenience on their side — benefits that Dr. Giroir repeatedly underscored in a call with reporters. He noted the slow and bumpy rollout of testing in the United States, where speedy tests results are still a relative rarity.Dr. Giroir said it was “not yet obvious” whether widespread at-home testing would be successful.Susan Butler-Wu, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine, said at-home testing might streamline the testing process. People who feel sick could test themselves and determine whether they need to isolate or seek treatment in a matter of minutes.But outsourcing testing to the general public also carries risks.Incorrect results, for example, could be tougher to catch, interpret and act on when people test themselves at home. False negatives might embolden people to mingle with others, hastening the spread of the virus, while false positives could unnecessarily keep people out of work or school.And both types of errors could erode public trust in testing.Dr. Butler-Wu also noted that rapid test results might not make it to the right care providers and to public health officials when collected at home.If results aren’t properly reported, she said, “you’re flying blind — you don’t know the prevalence in your community.” </body>

	<title>Marvel’s Latest Frontier? In ‘WandaVision,’ It’s the Suburbs</title>
	<author>Dave Itzkoff</author>
	<body>In the time they have spent playing Marvel heroes together, Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany have gotten extremely comfortable with each other. Not even a little misdirected mucus during the making of their new Disney+ series, “WandaVision” — an incident they affectionately describe as “Snotgate” — flustered them for long.It occurred when their characters — a woman enhanced with psychic powers named Wanda Maximoff (Olsen) and a synthetic android called Vision (Bettany) — shared a kiss in especially cold weather. And some disagreements remain about the specifics of how it transpired.“Paul was not in a good mood for me to make a joke about his snot,” Olsen said in a video interview with Bettany last month. “It was my first time ever seeing him get truly defensive about anything.”Here, Bettany leaned into his camera and replied, sotto voce: “It was her snot. Anyway.”They agreed that their differences were quickly settled, and now they can laugh about it. “It was over as quickly as it happened,” Bettany said.Such are the perils of playing a troubled woman and a sophisticated robot who have fallen in love with each other — characters who first met in the 2015 Marvel blockbuster “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” returned for several sequels and now get the chance to carry their own television series when “WandaVision” makes its debut on Jan. 15.Like its main characters, “WandaVision” is, well, weird. It’s not strictly an action-packed spectacle in the manner of hit movies like “Avengers: Endgame” — it’s a hybrid of drama and comedy that pays faithful homage to vintage sitcoms like “The Dick Van Dyke Show,” “Bewitched” and “Family Ties.”Now, through circumstances beyond anyone’s control, “WandaVision” has to carry even more weight. When the pandemic prompted Marvel to reshuffle its release calendar, “WandaVision” became the studio’s first attempt to bring the superhero soap opera of the Marvel Cinematic Universe to an original Disney+ series, in hopes that it will do for its comic-book characters what “The Mandalorian” has done for “Star Wars,” another Disney-owned fantasy franchise.These are unexpectedly high stakes but, like the love-struck misfits they play, the stars of “WandaVision” see them as reasons to be more understanding of each other, snot and all.As Olsen explained: “It’s daunting to take these movie-theater characters and put them on a small screen. There’s a lot of firsts that are a little scary as an actor.”Bettany agreed. “We need to feel safe with each other,” he added, “to do the thing we’re doing.”Both actors entered the Marvel family in unusual ways. Bettany, a star of films like “A Beautiful Mind” and “Margin Call,” was cast in the first M.C.U. movie, “Iron Man,” to play the voice of Tony Stark’s artificial intelligence system, J.A.R.V.I.S.“I would turn up for one day’s work and solve everyone’s problems,” Bettany said. “I could go, ‘The bad guys are coming, sir!’ And then they would give me a bag of money, and I would go home. It was lovely.”Bettany was upgraded to an onscreen role for “Age of Ultron,” which also introduced Olsen (“Martha Marcy May Marlene”) as Wanda. At that time, Olsen said: “I was getting typecast as emotionally struggling young women in small genre films. They were like, let’s put her in a bigger genre film and make her the mentally unhealthy struggling hero.”Though the spotlight shone brighter on co-stars like Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr., Bettany and Olsen bonded over the strangeness of their enterprise, like a behind-the-scenes debate they observed over whether Vision should have android genitalia. (Mercifully, the answer was no.)As they went onto films like “Captain America: Civil War,” they found that they shared an appreciation for diligence and preparedness, even on a hectic Marvel set.At one point on that film, Olsen said, “I asked Paul if he wanted to run lines with me for the next week. And he had his lines memorized for next week. I was like, this is going to be a great working relationship.”But Vision was seemingly killed in “Avengers: Infinity War,” and the following year, “Endgame” concluded the narrative arcs of major heroes like Iron Man and Captain America.Marvel was exploring story lines for its next wave of movies when Disney introduced its Disney+ streaming service, with the expectation that Marvel would also provide original content for it.Kevin Feige, the Marvel Studios president, said that a Disney+ series offered the opportunity to flesh out the relationship between Wanda and Vision that had been only hinted at in the movies.“The entirety of the love story between Wanda and Vision was basically one shot in ‘Age of Ultron’ where he swoops in to rescue her, they make eye contact and fly away,” Feige said. “Then a bit more in ‘Civil War,’ a bit more in ‘Infinity War,’ but it all goes bad very quickly in that movie.”In several decades of comics, Vision and Wanda shared a romance that was much more intricate: They dated, married, had two sons, broke up and reconciled. (Also — and here is where it gets messy — Wanda discovered that her sons were actually the missing pieces of a demonic villain, who reabsorbed them; then she lost and regained the memory of her vanished children; and then she vengefully unleashed her powers to rewrite reality itself.)With “WandaVision,” Feige said that he had wanted to honor the complexity of the title characters and Wanda’s reality-warping abilities but also to leaven the story with tributes to sitcom history.“I feel like I’ve justified all the time I spent playing with action figures in my backyard,” he said. “All the time I spent watching Nick at Nite and old TV shows, I haven’t justified yet. This show is helping me do that.”The series finds Wanda and Vision — now somehow alive — residing in suburban bliss, not entirely sure of why they are cycling through various eras of television history and encountering veteran Marvel performers like Kat Dennings (as her “Thor” character, Darcy Lewis) and Randall Park (reprising his “Ant-Man and the Wasp” role of Jimmy Woo) as well as new additions to the roster, like Teyonah Parris (as Monica Rambeau) and Kathryn Hahn (playing a perplexingly nosy neighbor named Agnes).As with many of the Marvel movies, there is also a central mystery running through “WandaVision,” asking viewers to ponder the ever-changing reality that envelops its romantic leads.Jac Schaeffer, the head writer of the series, said that the show’s comic exterior was intended to lure its audience into its further layers of intrigue.“You enter a sitcom episode with the understanding it’s going to make you feel good and it’s all going to be OK at the end,” said Schaeffer, who also worked on “Captain Marvel” and “Black Widow.”What “WandaVision” adds to this formula, she said, is an element of “creepiness — the idea of shattering that safety in a calculated way.”Matt Shakman, who directed all nine episodes of “WandaVision,” said that the series ultimately tells a story of “grief and trauma and how we hold onto our hope.”“Wanda is probably the person who has suffered the most of anyone in the M.C.U.,” he added. “And so the show is always grounded in that. Even though what you see are faithfully recreated television shows, there’s a lot more going on than meets the eye.”Shakman has previously directed shows like “Game of Thrones,” “Succession” and “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” and was himself a former child actor on TV sitcoms like “Diff’rent Strokes” and “Just the Ten of Us.” Directing “WandaVision,” he said, was “a gloriously schizophrenic job” that some days required orchestrating action sequences on green-screen sets, and some days involved shooting on the same sitcom stages where he once worked.For these TV tribute sequences, Shakman and his team worked carefully to reproduce the wardrobe and production design of shows like “I Dream of Jeannie” and “The Partridge Family,” using vintage lighting and camera lenses and filming in front of live studio audiences.Although the “WandaVision” actors were given two weeks of sitcom boot camp before filming started, they did not require much training to get into the spirit of things.Olsen is, of course, the younger sister of the former “Full House” stars Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen; she appeared in some of their later projects and grew up a fan of shows like “Laverne &amp; Shirley” and movies like “A Very Brady Sequel.”Bettany said that classic American shows were a regular part of his TV diet when he was growing up in England. He speculated that some of the religious exploration his family undertook in his childhood may have happened “because my mom was watching ‘Little House on the Prairie’ — we were in for a penny, in for a pound.”Had events unfolded according to Marvel’s earlier plans, the debut of “WandaVision” would have followed the theatrical releases of movies like “Black Widow,” “Eternals” and “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,” as well as the premiere of “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,” an action-oriented Disney+ series in a more familiar, “Avengers”-like mode.The pandemic required Marvel to reorganize this rollout, but Feige said that the studio’s carefully planned master narrative, stretched across its films and TV shows, had not been significantly affected.“If the run we had in 2018 and 2019 had gotten disrupted this way, in the buildup to ‘Endgame,’ it would have been a bigger headache,” he said. “With these projects, it worked well,” he went on, adding that the debut dates for the TV shows were shifted only “by a matter of weeks.”The creation of “WandaVision” was also affected by the pandemic; its actors left an environment where they could freely mingle with co-workers and returned to one, several months later, where “you finish your scene and you get whisked away into these hermetically sealed bubbles,” Bettany said.“I had a hard time with that,” Olsen said, her voice hardening in exaggerated anger. “I was like: ‘But I’m talking to the crew! This is for moral support!’”In that sense, the actors said, perhaps it was fitting that “WandaVision” should reach audiences at this moment, when both its narrative message and its making-of process reflect a human desire to keep going, no matter how unrecognizable the world becomes.“We’re all experiencing this extreme version of life right now,” Olsen said. But for a time, while she and her colleagues finished their work on the series, “We created this microcosm of humanity where we could communicate and problem-solve together,” she added. “There was something great about getting to come to work and experience that.”What Marvel has done consistently, for its characters, its cast members and its audience, is “create a home for people who wouldn’t necessarily find each other,” Bettany said.In the particular case of “WandaVision,” he added, “It’s about a group of people finding each other — people who are really getting their freak on — in a situation where it’s all right to be really different.”</body>

	<title>La mujer que abatida en el Capitolio apoyaba a Trump y a la teoría de la conspiración QAnon</title>
	<author>Dave Philipps</author>
	<body>Ashli Babbitt se había estado preparando para este día, para la jornada en la que los acontecimientos mundiales cambiarían de rumbo. La semana pasada, un amigo desanimado le preguntó en Twitter cuándo empezarían a ganar, a lo que Babbitt respondió: “El 6 de enero de 2021”.Ahora, su nombre estará relacionado con esa fecha y con las imágenes borrosas que muestran a una multitud de alborotadores rompiendo los vidrios de la puerta que conduce al Lobby del Presidente del Capitolio.Al frente de esa multitud estaba la pequeña figura de Babbitt, ataviada con botas para la nieve, jeans y una bandera de Trump que llevaba amarrada alrededor de su cuello como una capa.“¡Vamos! ¡Vamos!”, gritaba y luego dos hombres la levantaron hasta el borde de una ventana rota. Cuando asomó la cabeza a través del marco, un oficial de la policía del Capitolio, vestido de civil, disparó un tiro y ella cayó entre la multitud. La sangre comenzó a brotar de su boca.Un día después de la muerte de Babbitt, quien formaba parte de la turba que asaltó el Capitolio en medio del recuento de votos del Colegio Electoral, comienza a formarse un retrato de ella.Después de dos guerras y 14 años, Babbitt dejó la Fuerza Aérea y se instaló cerca del suburbio de clase trabajadora de San Diego donde se crió. La vida después del ejército no fue fácil. Después de trabajar brevemente en el departamento de seguridad en una planta de energía nuclear, estaba luchando por mantener a flote una empresa de suministro de piscinas.En la vida civil recobró su libertad para expresar opiniones políticas. Sus redes sociales eran un torrente de mensajes de admiración sobre el presidente Trump, la teoría de la conspiración QAnon y diatribas contra la inmigración, las drogas y los líderes demócratas en California.“Ustedes se niegan, se niegan a elegir a Estados Unidos por encima de su estúpido partido político, estoy tan cansada”, dijo en un video publicado en Twitter, dirigiéndose a los políticos de California. “Pueden considerarse avisados. Yo y el pueblo estadounidense. Estoy tan cansada de eso, pero me desperté, amigo, esto es absolutamente increíble”.Todas las personas cercanas a Babbitt han recibido la noticia con sorpresa. Su esposo, Aaron Babbitt, de 39 años, le dijo a una cadena afiliada de Fox en San Diego que le envió un mensaje unos 30 minutos antes del tiroteo, pero ella no le respondió.Su hermano, Roger Witthoeft, de 32 años, dijo que Babbitt no le había dicho a su familia que planeaba ir a Washington. Pero no le sorprendió que protestara.“Mi hermana tenía 35 años y pasó 14 en el ejército, para mí esa es la mayor parte de tu vida adulta consciente”, dijo Witthoeft, de Lakeside, California. “Si sientes que entregaste la mayor parte de tu vida a tu país y no te escuchan, es algo difícil de asimilar. Por eso estaba molesta”.Babbitt, que tenía cuatro hermanos menores, se crió en un hogar mayoritariamente apolítico, dijo Witthoeft. Su padre trabajaba en una empresa de instalación de pisos y su madre en un programa escolar. Babbitt se alistó en la Fuerza Aérea después de terminar la escuela secundaria.Cuando estaba en el servicio activo —de 2004 a 2008—, conoció y se casó con su primer marido, Timothy McEntee. Se alistó en las fuerzas de seguridad, un trabajo cuyas funciones incluyen vigilar las entradas de las bases de la Fuerza Aérea, y fue enviada a Afganistán e Irak.Luego sirvió en las Reservas de la Fuerza Aérea y la Guardia Nacional Aérea. En la guardia fue asignada a una unidad cerca de Washington que se conoce como los “Guardianes de la capital”, porque una de sus misiones es defender la ciudad. Las fuerzas de seguridad del escuadrón se entrenan regularmente con escudos y garrotes antidisturbios para lo que la Fuerza Aérea define como “misiones de disturbios civiles”. Fue enviada dos veces más a los Emiratos Árabes Unidos en 2012 y 2014, según una portavoz de la Fuerza Aérea.En 2016, Babbitt dejó el ejército con un rango relativamente bajo, varios años antes de que pudiera recibir una pensión y otros beneficios.Para ese entonces, había encontrado otra fuente de ingresos trabajando en el departamento de seguridad en la planta nuclear de Calvert Cliffs en Maryland. Estuvo allí de 2015 a 2017, según un representante de Exelon, la compañía de energía que administra la planta.Allí fue donde conoció a Babbitt, quien trabajó en esas instalaciones desde 2007 y renunció en 2017, dijo el representante. Los dos regresaron a su California natal y ella solicitó el divorcio de McEntee en 2018.La transición no fue muy fluida. En 2016, la exnovia de Babbitt solicitó a un tribunal una orden de protección, y le dijo al tribunal que la exmilitar, que en ese entonces se llamaba Ashli McEntee, la había perseguido en una carretera y había chocado tres veces la parte trasera de su auto.“Me gritó y me amenazó verbalmente”, dice la denuncia. El tribunal otorgó una orden de protección. Al año siguiente, la exnovia volvió a solicitar una orden de protección, que el tribunal concedió.Poco después de eso, la mujer se mudó a California, donde ayudó a comprar Fowlers Pool Service and Supply, una empresa donde su hermano, Witthoeft, dijo que había trabajado.“Todos trabajamos juntos como familia: mi otro hermano pequeño, yo, su esposo y mi tío”, dijo Witthoeft. “Fue algo agradable, un asunto familiar”.Debating a criminal referral. The Jan. 6 House committee has grown divided over whether to make a criminal referral of former President Donald J. Trump to the Justice Department, even though it has concluded that it has enough evidence to do so. The debate centers on whether a referral would backfire by politically tainting the expanding federal investigation.Cooperating with investigators. Pat A. Cipollone and Patrick F. Philbi, two of Mr. Trump’s top White House lawyers, met with the Jan. 6 House committee, while Ali Alexander, a prominent organizer of pro-Trump events after the 2020 election, said he would assist in the federal investigation.Contempt charges. The House voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino Jr., two close allies of Mr. Trump, after the pair defied subpoenas from the special committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.Pero Babbitt parecía tener dificultades en los negocios. En 2017, obtuvo un costoso préstamo comercial a corto plazo. En efecto, significaba que su negocio tendría que pagar una tasa de interés que luego calculó en los documentos judiciales en 169 por ciento.A los pocos días de firmar el contrato de préstamo, dejó de hacer pagos y solo reembolsó alrededor de 3400 de los 65.000 dólares que le pidió al prestamista, EBF Partners, según muestran los documentos. Pronto fue demandada por esa entidad financiera.Desde el punto de vista político, Babbitt se mostraba abiertamente a favor de Trump. En la puerta de la empresa de suministro de piscinas, un cartel declara que es una “zona autónoma libre de mascarillas, mejor conocida como Estados Unidos”, donde “nos damos la mano como hombres, chocamos los puños como amigos”.Dejar el ejército la había liberado para participar en política, algo que disfrutaba, dijo su hermano.“Esa era una de sus cosas: por primera vez en su vida, podía decir lo que quería decir y no tenía que reprimirlo”, dijo. Según Witthoeft, estaba frustrada por la cantidad de personas sin hogar en San Diego y el reto de administrar una pequeña empresa.“Mi hermana era una californiana normal”, dijo. “Los problemas que le molestaban, eran las cosas por las que todos estamos enojados”.Sus cuentas en las redes sociales sugieren que, cada vez más, apoyaba a la teoría de la conspiración QAnon que ha afirmado que las elecciones presidenciales de 2020 fueron robadas por una camarilla de élite que adora a Satanás, y que le correspondía a la gente común reinstalar a Trump.Ella retuiteó una publicación que prometía un levantamiento violento que conduciría a la segunda toma de posesión de Trump.“Nada nos detendrá”, escribió en Twitter, el día antes de su fallecimiento. “Pueden intentarlo y tratar de intentarlo, pero la tormenta está aquí y está descendiendo sobre DC en menos de 24 horas…. ¡De la oscuridad a la luz!”.Su hermano dijo que le apasionaba la causa de Trump y creía que estaba defendiendo al pueblo estadounidense.“Sé que a ella le importó mucho eso, al final de su vida”, dijo. “Le importó tanto que murió por eso”.Candice Reed colaboró en este reportaje.

	<title>Gabby Giffords: 10 Years Ago, a Gunman Tried to Silence Me</title>
	<author>Gabrielle Giffords</author>
	<body>Ten years ago today I went to meet with my constituents in front of a grocery store in Tucson, Ariz. I was a young congresswoman, just sworn in for a third term; it had been a long and hard campaign in a charged national environment. Soon after I arrived that morning, a gunman opened fire. He shot me in the head at close range. Eighteen other people were shot that morning. Six died.What’s it like to survive in a world forever changed? How do you grieve what is lost, but move on with determination? How do you reckon with your country in a new way?These are timely questions for Americans these days. We have endured a lot over the last year, and our hard times aren’t over. Just two days ago an angry mob stormed the U.S. Capitol, encouraged by the president. I worried as I waited to hear if my husband, Senator Mark Kelly, and his staff were safe as they sheltered in place.The fear I felt as I waited was a terrifying echo of the fear he endured exactly a decade ago this week. It echoed the dread that millions of parents have experienced when they have received reports of school lockdowns and neighborhood shootings. This time that fear was shared by the families of so many elected officials and their teams and Capitol staff as the world watched while the walls of Congress were breached.On the 10th anniversary of that shooting that nearly killed me, during a week in which our country reflects in shock, I want to share what I have learned about resilience and determination. It starts not with me, but with Abraham Lincoln.All my life, I’ve studied President Lincoln. In the summer of 1862, just a few months after a cold and desperate wartime winter when his young son Willie died, and a few weeks before he gave the original Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln wrote to a faltering young cadet, Quintin Campbell. “Adhere to your purpose and you will soon feel as well as you ever did. On the contrary, if you falter, and give up, you will lose the power of keeping any resolution, and will regret it all your life. Take the advice of a friend, who, though he never saw you, deeply sympathizes with you, and stick to your purpose.”The president had just experienced a profound loss, the uncertainty of war surrounded him. And yet his vision and purpose were clear: a nation united, more free and more just, achieved through the resolution and determination of his fellow Americans. That steadfastness gave him strength.I never dreamed I would have anything in common with Lincoln. But we were both the targets of an assassin’s bullet. Only I lived, by grace, luck, the dedication of doctors and nurses and the support of my friends and family.That January morning, I had been looking forward to spending time with the people I represented, talking about hopes and needs. It was the part of the job I loved the most. Since then, I have fought every day to regain all that I lost, from walking to speaking to being able to serve my country. I have had to re-examine my own hopes and expectations. It is exhausting. But I stick to my purpose: I still want to make the world a better place. All of the sense of possibility I felt when I arrived in that parking lot 10 years ago has stayed with me.I carry with me every day that while I lived, wonderful Americans died: Judge John Roll — a Republican who never let our political differences prevent us from respectful conversation and admiration. A third-grader named Christina-Taylor Green, just 9 years old, who was there that day to meet me because she was interested in running for office someday. My staffer and friend, Gabe Zimmerman. This anniversary is not only mine, but belongs to their families, and all those who survived, as well.The last year has been so hard for all of us. The pandemic has ravaged our families and communities. I lost my friend Manny Alvarado to Covid-19. Jobs have been lost. Kids are trying to learn on screens. It’s heartbreaking. People are scared, and they’re angry. All around us is rancor, rage and hate, culminating in the scenes this week of Americans attempting to undermine their own democracy. It’s going to take a long time before we feel strong again.And yet I remain not only determined, but optimistic. I draw upon my experiences these last 10 years. Working with local leaders and activists, the gun safety movement has grown from tentative and scattered to passionate, diverse and effective. We’ve taken on the N.R.A. and the corporate gun manufacturers and passed hundreds of laws at the local level. We passed universal background checks through the House on a 50-vote, bipartisan basis in 2019. We elected a president and statewide leaders dedicated and determined to reduce gun violence.Setbacks are only that: temporary delays. I have worked every day to move my right arm and leg. I have trained every day to get my speech back. This summer I gave my longest speech ever — in support of President-elect Joe Biden and his vision for a safer, stronger America.There’s no magic recovery in store for us as a nation. We have a long way to go. We are living with the consequences of years of inflammatory speech and false accusations. Through hard work, intention and commitment our country will overcome the rage of those who stormed the Capitol with Confederate flags and symbols of hate. We draw strength from the bravery and determination of our first responders and frontline workers. They inspire me. We will move ahead together as I did and still do every day — one foot after another. When one person flags, another person steps in — to lift up the weak, and give strength to the doubtful. Together, our resolve and determination will be fuel for years to come.Gabrielle Giffords was a Democratic representative from Arizona from 2007 to 2012. She is the founder of Giffords, a national organization dedicated to saving lives from gun violence.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

	<title>Betsy DeVos, education secretary, is the second cabinet member to resign.</title>
	<author>Chris Cameron</author>
	<body>Education Secretary Betsy DeVos submitted her resignation in a letter to President Trump on Thursday, saying she would step down the next day over the rampage at the Capitol by his supporters.Ms. DeVos joins a growing exodus of administration officials in the final days of the Trump administration. She is the second cabinet-level official to step down; Elaine Chao, the transportation secretary, also resigned on Thursday.“We should be highlighting and celebrating your administration’s many accomplishments on behalf of the American people,” Ms. DeVos wrote in the letter, which was obtained by The New York Times. “Instead, we are left to clean up the mess caused by violent protesters overrunning the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to undermine the people’s business.”“That behavior was unconscionable for our country,” she added. “There is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation, and it is the inflection point for me.”Ms. DeVos was one of the first cabinet secretaries to condemn the violent mob on Capitol Hill.“The peaceful transfer of power is what separates American representative democracy from banana republics,” Ms. DeVos said in a statement posted to Twitter on Wednesday evening, hours after the storming of the Capitol. “The work of the people must go on.”Ms. DeVos was one of the most effective, polarizing and longest-serving Cabinet members in the Trump administration. She was seen as fiercely loyal to the president, at least publicly.In her resignation letter, Ms. DeVos praised President Trump for championing her school choice agenda, in which she sought to bolster voucher programs that allow students to seek alternatives to public schools. She also saluted one aspect of his coronavirus response, saying that she believed “history will show we were correct in our repeated urging of and support for schools reopening this year.” But it was loyalty to her constitutional oath, Ms. DeVos said, that had prompted her to resign. “Impressionable children are watching all of this, and they are learning from us,” she said. “They must know from us that America is greater than what transpired yesterday.” Ms. DeVos’s resignation drew cheers from her opponents, particularly teacher’s unions and groups that had forcefully opposed her rollbacks of civil rights protections for children of color and transgender students.Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, issued a two-word statement: “Good Riddance.” But other critics praised her for protesting the president’s actions. “This doesn’t make up for all of her bad decisions, and the harm she has done to education reform, but still, she deserves kudos for this one,” tweeted Michael J. Petrilli, the president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative research organization. </body>

	<title>Side Hustles and Handouts: A Tough Year Ahead for U.K. Theater Workers</title>
	<author>Alex Marshall</author>
	<body>LONDON — Last August, Tom Boucher was among the first in Britain’s theater industry to get back to work, after theaters were closed for months because of the coronavirus.For six weeks, Boucher, 29, was a lighting technician for “Sleepless: A Musical Romance” a show based on the popular 1993 movie “Sleepless in Seattle.” He felt so lucky to have a job again, he recalled in a telephone interview.Every day, until the run ended, Boucher went to the Troubadour Wembley Park Theater, where he was tested for the coronavirus before bathing the stage with warm tones to conjure the show’s romantic atmosphere.But that joy was short-lived, he said.Freelancers — both actors and backstage crew members like Boucher — are the lifeblood of Britain’s theaters, making up an estimated 70 percent of the country’s 290,000 workers in the performing arts, according to U.K. Theater, a trade body. But that workforce’s flexibility makes it particularly exposed to any changes in coronavirus restrictions.Facing a new wave of the virus, England on Monday went into a national lockdown again. Theatrical performances are banned for months, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said restrictions could last until March 31, which means Britain’s estimated 200,000 freelance theater workers are once more facing financial trouble and looking for ways to get by.Boucher guessed it would be April, at best, before he could work again in a theater. On Monday, with bills piling up, he applied to the Theater Artists Fund, a body that gives emergency grants to theater freelancers imperiled by the pandemic. He was hoping for 1,000 pounds, or about $1,350.“I know it sounds silly,” Boucher said, “but £1,000 can really go a long way at the moment.”The Theatre Artists Fund, which was created by the film and theater director Sam Mendes as a response to the pandemic, gave out around 4,600 grants last year in three funding rounds, Eva Mason, a spokeswoman for the program, said in an email. It reopened to applications on Monday and received “hundreds” in two days, she added.Just a few weeks ago, Britain’s theaters seemed to be on the verge of a triumphant return. On Dec. 5, “Six,” the hit musical about the wives of Henry VIII, returned to the West End, in London, alongside several other shows including a concert version of “Les Misérables.” But then restrictions were tightened in the city, forcing those to shut, and then came the nationwide lockdown — England’s third since March.According to Freelancers Make Theater Work, a campaigning organization, 36 percent of freelancers in the industry are not eligible for help under the British government’s coronavirus support programs. “I fell through every single possible crack to get government support,” Boucher said.Another private program, the Fleabag Support Fund, created by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and the producer Francesca Moody, also saw a boom in applications this week. It opens for five days each month to applicants, and has given out 772 grants since April, worth an average £742.But such generosity only goes so far. In telephone interviews this week, four theater freelancers said they had set up their own businesses to get through the pandemic; another said he was working as a delivery driver; and another said she was relying on a combination of unemployment checks and parental support.“The situation actually feels worse than March,” said Jessica Howells, a sound engineer who had been working on “Phantom of the Opera” in the West End when the pandemic struck. “Back then I didn’t know anyone who had coronavirus. Now, I know a lot of people,” she added.Last summer, Howells was laid off, so she started a baking business, she said. She now makes brownies and party cakes that are delivered to customers across Britain. “It’s enough to pay the bills, to survive,” she said. Her partner, also a theater freelancer, now delivers eggs door-to-door, she added.Ti Green, a Tony Award-nominated costume and set designer, started a business a little closer to her usual line of work, making bespoke women’s wear. She loved still doing something creative, she said in a telephone interview, but was desperate to “get back into a dark theater, where everyone’s working together to create.”She had no idea when that would be, she said, but added, “I’m trying not to lose hope.”Moody of the Fleabag Support Fund said she was worried that many freelancers would leave the industry for good. “I do think we’ll lose a large swath to other jobs,” she said. “It’s a real problem for theater, as we’ll have a smaller talent pool,” she added.None of the six freelancers interviewed said they were intending to change career. One, at least, was trying to channel a new line of work back into something dramatic. Stewart Wright, 46, an actor, said in a telephone interview that last year he started working as a courier to get by. Every Friday, Saturday and Sunday night, he cycled around Bristol, England, delivering takeout.Bristol has many hills, and Wright can only last four hours on his bike per night, he said, but the experience had inspired him creatively: He was now working on a script for a sitcom, called “Downhill,” about a middle-aged man who loses his high-profile job and ends up as a pizza delivery guy.Wright had not given up performing entirely, he added. Last month, he co-created a 10-minute Christmas show which he performed, dressed as Santa Claus, on doorsteps in Bristol. (The production was a partnership with the Tobacco Factory theater in the city.) “I suppose I’ve been in this fight or flight mode, where I’m just trying to piece together a living from all sorts of stuff,” Wright added.He doesn’t expect to get any theatrical work this year, he said, but was trying not to think about that. “I’m not spending energy on asking, ‘When will I get work in a theater again?’ as it’s just wasted,” he said. Wright needed all the energy he could get, after all: He had to get back on his delivery bike.</body>

	<title>¿Cuándo recibirás el pago del paquete de estímulo? Tal vez debas solicitarlo al declarar impuestos</title>
	<author>Tara Siegel Bernard</author>
	<body>Millones de estadounidenses ya recibieron su pago de 600 dólares del paquete de ayuda federal. Pero algunos tendrán que esperar un poco más y puede que requieran presentar su declaración de impuestos para cobrarlo.Por ley, según el IRS, deben emitirse los pagos de estímulo para el 15 de enero. Luego de esa fecha, quienes tienen derecho a la ayuda pero no la han recibido, deben presentar un reclamo a cuenta de su declaración de impuestos de 2020.Y algunos pagos que ya fueron enviados han sido devueltos al Departamento del Tesoro porque se direccionaron a cuentas inactivas o temporales a las que los contribuyentes no pueden acceder.No queda claro cuántas personas no han recibido el dinero pero la empresa de contabilidad Jackson Hewitt dijo que el Servicio de Impuestos Internos (IRS por su sigla en inglés) había enviado pagos a más de 13 millones de cuentas bancarias que ya no estaban abiertas o en operación.La gran mayoría de los pagos ya se han enviado. Más de 147 millones, que suman 142.000 millones de dólares se han programado: 113 millones se realizaron como depósito directo (lo que presumiblemente incluye pagos devueltos), mientras que 34 millones se entregarán en cheque o tarjeta de débito, según cifras del IRS entregadas al Comité de Medios y Arbitrios de la Cámara de Representantes.El IRS dijo que el momento en que se dio la legislación del paquete de ayuda, firmada por el presidente Donald Trump el 27 de diciembre, había causado problemas. “Debido a la velocidad con que la ley requería que el IRS emitiera una segunda ronda de Pagos de Impacto Económico, algunos pagos pudieron haberse enviado a cuentas que ya están cerradas o inoperativas”, dijo en un comunicado la agencia.Sucedió así: compañías como TurboTax, H&amp;R Block y Jackson Hewitt a veces abren cuentas temporales para los clientes cuando preparan sus declaraciones. Por ejemplo, a los clientes que eligen que se les deduzcan las tarifas de preparación de su reembolso se les pueden emitir una de estas cuentas, lo que permite a la empresa tributaria tomar su parte y luego transferir el resto. Después de eso, las cuentas generalmente se cierran o quedan inactivas, pero pueden seguir vinculadas a los contribuyentes en los registros del Servicio de Impuestos Internos. Los pagos que no pueden ser procesados por la institución financiera receptora deben ser devueltos al Departamento del Tesoro.Un problema similar también retrasó algunos de los pagos de estímulo enviados en abril.“Es decepcionante que el IRS no haya solucionado este problema, del que ha sabido durante meses, a la luz de la probabilidad de una nueva ronda de pagos de estímulo”, dijo Lauren Saunders, directora adjunta del Centro Nacional de Derecho del Consumidor. “La gente que necesita dinero ahora puede tener que esperar meses hasta que pueda presentar una declaración de impuestos y obtener su reembolso, a menos que las compañías de preparación de impuestos puedan reenviar los fondos”.El IRS no reenviará automáticamente los pagos hasta que lleguen al destinatario, como hizo en primavera. En cambio, quienes no reciban sus pagos deben recuperar el dinero en su declaración de impuestos de 2020 al solicitar el Crédito de Recuperación de Reembolso, que se puede encontrar en la línea 30 del formulario 1040 o 1040-SR de 2020.Los adultos individuales con ingresos brutos ajustados en sus declaraciones de impuestos de 2019 de hasta 75.000 dólares al año son elegibles para un pago de 600 dólares, y una pareja (o alguien cuyo cónyuge falleció en 2020) que gane hasta 150.000 dólares al año recibirá el doble de esa cantidad. También hay un pago de 600 dólares por cada hijo para las familias que cumplan con esos requisitos de ingresos.Los contribuyentes pueden comprobar el estado de sus pagos de estímulo con la herramienta Obtener Mi Pago del IRS. Si el pago fue enviado a un número de cuenta desconocido, podría ser porque el IRS lo envió a una de esas cuentas temporales.Y si la herramienta muestra “Estado de pago #2 — No disponible”, ese es otro indicador de que su pago no va a llegar, dijo el IRS.Ese es el mensaje que Brandy Dunigan, una técnica farmacéutica de 36 años, recibió el martes. Recibió el primer pago de estímulo en primavera sin problemas. Pero se preguntaba dónde estaba el segundo después de que algunos de sus compañeros de trabajo recibieran sus pagos durante el fin de semana, y luego sus padres recibieron los suyos el lunes.No estaba claro por qué la herramienta de IRS indicaba que el estado de su pago no estaba disponible. Pero ella ha usado TaxSlayer, un servicio de preparación de impuestos en línea, para presentar su declaración durante los últimos años, y la empresa dedujo sus honorarios de preparación de impuestos de su reembolso. La compañía dijo en su sitio que las cuentas temporales de estos clientes probablemente estaban cerradas o inactivas.“He tenido la suerte de trabajar durante toda la pandemia”, dijo Dunigan, de Lake Somerset, Mich. “No dependo del dinero para pagar las facturas. Pero conozco a gente que depende de él, y no puedo decirles lo furiosa que me pone que la gente que cuenta con el estímulo tenga que esperar”.TaxSlayer y otras compañías de preparación de impuestos dijeron que trabajaban para conseguir pagos a los clientes donde pudieran.H&amp;R Block dijo que ya está pasando los pagos de estímulo a los clientes a través de sus cuentas bancarias o mediante una tarjeta de débito prepaga. Una portavoz de TurboTax dijo que la compañía estaba trabajando con el IRS para ayudar a los contribuyentes a recibir sus pagos lo antes posible. Y Jackson Hewitt sugirió en su sitio web que los clientes deberían considerar tomar la devolución de sus impuestos de 2020.Tara Siegel Bernard escribe sobre finanzas personales.

	<title>South Korean Court Orders Japan to Pay Compensation for Wartime Sexual Slavery</title>
	<author>Choe Sang-Hun</author>
	<body>SEOUL, South Korea — A South Korean court on Friday ordered the Japanese government to pay $91,800 each to 12 Korean women forced into sexual slavery for Japan’s troops during World War II. The ruling, the first of its kind in South Korea, is likely to aggravate the already chilly relations between Washington’s two key allies in Asia.“The court recognizes that the accused committed illegal acts and that the plaintiffs suffered extreme psychological and physical pain hard to imagine,” Judge Kim Jeong-gon said in his decision.The ruling is largely symbolic; the Japanese government said on Friday that the Korean court had no jurisdiction over Japan and that it would “never accept” the order. But the decision could further complicate Washington’s efforts to bring South Korea and Japan closer together to counter North Korea’s nuclear threat and China’s growing military influence in the region.Though South Korea and Japan face similar threats from North Korea, there is a deep-seated mistrust between the two countries rooted in Japan’s colonial rule of Korea, from 1910 to 1945​​.​ The issue of the Japanese Army’s coercing Korean and other women into sexual slavery is the most emotional historical dispute keeping Seoul and Tokyo apart.“This is a landmark ruling,” said an advocacy group in Seoul that speaks for the women who filed the lawsuits, the Korean Council for Justice and Remembrance for the Issues of Military Sexual Slavery by Japan.A decision on another case, in which 11 women who had been forced into sexual slavery, known euphemistically as “comfort women,” are seeking similar compensation from Tokyo, is scheduled for Wednesday.The advocacy group said that the lawsuits had been filed as part of the women’s attempt to confront the Japanese government, which they accused of whitewashing the history of wartime sexual slavery by its military.“The Japanese government should honor the ruling and pay the compensation immediately,” the group said, adding that some of the women had died since filing the lawsuits.The plaintiffs in the civil lawsuit decided on Friday filed their case with the Seoul Central District Court in 2013. They accused Japan of coercing or luring them into sexual slavery in wartime brothels run for the country’s troops. Each demanded 100 million won ($91,800) in compensation. Only five of the original plaintiffs are still living.Historians say that tens of thousands of women, many of them Korean, were in the ​frontline ​brothels​​ from the early 1930s until 1945.​ It was not until 1991​, when a South Korean woman named Kim Hak-soon made the first public testimony on her painful​ wartime​ experiences, that the issue went global. ​A ​total of 2​40 women have ​since ​come forward in South Korea, but ​only 16 — all in their 80s and 90s — are still alive.The Japanese government did not participate in the trial, refusing to accept notices from the South Korean court informing it of the legal challenge and asking for a response. The court made the notices public online​ and held its first hearing in April of last year.Speaking with reporters on Friday, Katsunobu Kato, chief cabinet secretary to Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga of Japan, said that the court’s decision was “extremely regrettable” and that the Japanese government had formally protested to its South Korean counterpart.“We have repeatedly expressed that the Japanese government is not subject to Korean jurisdiction under the principle of exemption from sovereignty under international law,” Mr. Kato said.In its ruling, the court said that it could not accept the immunity claim because the case involved “anti-humanity acts systematically planned and perpetrated by the accused.”Yoon Ji-hyun, director of Amnesty International Korea, said that the ruling was significant because it was “the first time a South Korean court held the Japanese government responsible for the sexual slavery by the Japanese military and opened the way to restore justice for the survivors.”South Korea’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Friday, “We respect the court’s ruling and will do what we can to help restore the honor and dignity of the comfort women victims.” It added, “We will closely study the impact this ruling will have on diplomatic relations and make various efforts to continue constructive and future-oriented cooperation between the two nations.”The countries previously tried to close the chapter on World War II sexual slavery ​when Seoul and Tokyo announced in December 2015 what they called a “final and irreversible” settlement.In the deal, Japan expressed responsibility and apologized anew to the ​women, promising to set up an $8.3 million fund to help provide old-age care. Washington hailed the deal. But some of the women have since rejected it, saying it failed to specify Japan’s “legal” responsibility or to provide official reparations.Kazuhiko Togo, a former Japanese diplomat who is now director of Kyoto Sangyo University’s Institute for World Studies, said that 36 of the 48 women who were alive at the time of the 2015 deal had accepted payments from the funds.“On the one hand, my position is that as a perpetrator country, at least we need to have several moral obligations to remember, and from that point of view ‘enough’ or not is not a matter which we the perpetrator country should judge,” Mr. Togo said. But legally, he added, “I don’t think the Koreans have the right to pronounce the Japanese guilty.”Mr. Togo said that if the Korean courts were to try to confiscate Japanese government assets to fulfill the judgment, “Korea and Japan will not be able to maintain normal diplomatic relations.”He added: “I deeply think this is not in the interest of Korea or of Japan.”Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said that Tokyo would deem the ruling “an escalation in a pattern of weaponizing history and breaking international agreements.”He added, “The economic fallout will be difficult to gauge during the pandemic, but the diplomatic implication is to complicate the incoming Biden administration’s plans for trilateral cooperation to deal with North Korea and China.”​Relations between South Korea and Japan had already been frosty for years over another issue from the colonial era: wartime slave labor. In 2018, South Korea’s Supreme Court ruled that Japanese companies must compensate Korean men who had been forced into labor during World War II. Japan vehemently denounced the ruling.Japan accused South Korea of undermining the 1965 treaty that established diplomatic ties between the two nations, under which Japan provided South Korea with $500 million in aid and cheap loans. Tokyo insisted that all claims arising from its colonial rule, including those involving forced laborers and sexually enslaved women, had been settled by the treaty.In 2019, Japan imposed export controls​ on South Korea in a move widely seen as retaliation for the 2018 Supreme Court ruling. ​ The trade dispute soon spread to security ties, with South Korea ​threatening to abandon an intelligence-sharing agreement​ with Tokyo that Washington considered vital to maintaining cooperation among the three nations.Seoul did not follow through with its threat. But on-and-off attempts by both governments to narrow their differences have gone nowhere. The ruling on Friday will most likely add to the bad blood​.Motoko Rich contributed reporting from Tokyo.</body>

	<title>Teaching Resources to Help Students Make Sense of the Rampage at the Capitol</title>
	<author>The Learning Network</author>
	<body>Not since the War of 1812, when British forces set fire to the Capitol, have the halls of power in Washington been overtaken by violent intruders as they were on Jan. 6, writes The Times.As the world watched this tableau of violence and mayhem live, teachers immediately realized that the ordinary curriculum would need to give way:What happened and why? What does it mean for American democracy? Where does the nation go from here?Below, some suggestions from The Learning Network for using Times materials — articles, photos, videos, Opinion pieces, graphics and more — for teaching about these and other key questions. You can also find a list of excellent additional resources from other educational organizations.Finally, we offer an invitation to your students to join the conversation. On Jan. 6 we asked, “What Are Your Reactions to the Storming of the Capitol by a Pro-Trump Mob?” and already over 300 teenagers have posted their thoughts. We’d be honored to hear from yours, too.Part I: Get the facts.Organizations like Teaching Tolerance, Facing History and Ourselves and the Anti-Defamation League have helpful, specific tips for beginning a discussion about this upsetting event, and all recommend ways to set the stage so that students can process and share emotions first — “addressing the ‘heart’ before the ‘head’,” as Facing History describes it.When your students are ready, help them understand the facts. What do they know — or think they know? What questions do they have?Invite them to read, view or listen to one or several of the following resources and then respond to the comprehension questions below:“After Pro-Trump Mob Storms Capitol, Congress Confirms Biden’s Win” (Article)“How a Pro-Trump Mob Stormed the U.S. Capitol” (Photos and Graphics)“‘Protesters Are in The Building’: How an Electoral Count Turned Into Chaos” (Video)“The Daily: An Assault on the Capitol” (Podcast)Comprehension Questions:1. Why was there a gathering of Trump loyalists in Washington on Jan. 6?2. Why was Congress meeting that day?3. What were lawmakers debating during the session and why? In what ways was this debate related to the rally that President Trump organized for that day?4. Summarize in your own words what happened when the mob stormed the Capitol.5. What role did Mr. Trump have in this event? How did he respond to the violence and vandalism of his supporters?6. How have Democrats and Republicans responded to the attack?Part II: Respond and react.Next, give students an opportunity to react to what they read, viewed or heard. They might:Respond to our related Student Opinion question and read what other teenagers have to say.Reflect using writing prompts from Facing History and Ourselves that address students’ “head, heart and conscience,” followed by a class discussion:Head: What information do we currently know about the insurrection that happened on January 6, 2021? What additional facts or information would you like to have?Heart: How do you feel about the insurrection and what is happening in the aftermath? Are there particular moments or images that stand out to you?Conscience: What do you believe was at stake in the events on January 6, 2021? What questions about right and wrong, fairness or injustice, did insurrection raise for you? How should individuals or politicians act in order to protect our democratic institutions?Write or create something in response to what the students learned: an editorial or letter to the editor, political cartoon, illustration, meme, video, poem or anything else. For instance, here is a poem that a teenager posted in our Student Opinion forum, excerpted below:My democracy is dead. it was never alivewe pretend to care, pretend to listen, the dam has run over.civil liberties and rights have become a thing of the past, hate andwoe has overtaken reasonDemocracy has died today.it was killed by those it swore to protect.Thick with the blood of fallen, the river rolls deep and damp.the stilted homes of the dammed are long gonethe trail has turned into a crevasse.— Bailey Archuleta, San DiegoOr, continue to dig into this story with any of our many teaching ideas below.Part I: When, if at all, did President Trump cross a line?Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, stated on Wednesday: “What happened here today was an insurrection, incited by the president.” Representative Liz Cheney, Republican from Wyoming, told Fox News: “There’s no question the president formed the mob. The president incited the mob. The president addressed the mob. He lit the flame.” What do students think?In this activity, students will determine what level of responsibility President Trump has in inciting thousands of his supporters to storm the United States Capitol to disrupt the certification of the next president. They will determine at what point between the Nov. 3 election and the Jan. 6 riot, if at all, they think Mr. Trump crossed a line. And, if he did cross a line, what line did he cross? First, were any of his actions immoral or unpresidential? Second, did he act unlawfully or in violation of the Constitution he swore to defend?Nov. 14: After the election, the president refused to concede and instead insisted over and over, without providing any evidence, that the election was stolen from him. He became the first modern president in U.S. history to refuse to concede.“Mr. Trump has refused to concede the race to Mr. Biden, and he continues to falsely insist he would have won if not for what he has claimed were widespread voter irregularities. (In fact, top election officials across the country have said that there is no evidence that fraud or other irregularities played a role in the outcome.)” — The New York TimesNov. 19: The president pressured local and state officials to not certify the election results in states that he lost.“In a brazen step, the president invited Republican state leaders in Michigan to the White House as he and his allies try to prevent the state from certifying Joe Biden’s clear victory there.” — The New York TimesDec. 26: Following the Nov. 3 election, the president and his Republican allies initiated dozens of lawsuits challenging the results of the presidential election. In none of these courts, including in the Supreme Court, did they succeed in proving any claim of illegal voting.“After bringing some 60 lawsuits, and even offering financial incentive for information about fraud, Mr. Trump and his allies have failed to prove definitively any case of illegal voting on behalf of their opponent in court — not a single case of an undocumented immigrant casting a ballot, a citizen double voting, nor any credible evidence that legions of the voting dead gave Mr. Biden a victory that wasn’t his.” — The New York TimesJan. 3: The president pushed state officials in Georgia “to find 11,780 votes,” enough to make him the winner.“President Trump pressured Georgia’s Republican secretary of state to ‘find’ him enough votes to overturn the presidential election and vaguely threatened him with ‘a criminal offense’ during an hourlong telephone call on Saturday, according to an audio recording of the conversation.” — The New York TimesNoon, Jan. 6: The president held a rally near the White House the same day that Congress was to certify the election, telling his supporters that “you will never take back our country with weakness.” Hours later, Trump supporters stormed the Capitol and disrupted the certification process.“Mr. Trump was somber as he got into the presidential motorcade for the short ride over to the Ellipse, where he made clear in his roughly 70-minute speech that he was furious with Mr. Pence and that he wanted the people gathered on the National Mall to go to the Capitol immediately afterward in protest of what he falsely claimed was a stolen election.” — The New York Times4:17 p.m., Jan. 6: The president waited two hours during the riot at the Capitol before he urged his supporters in a video message on Twitter to go home. In the message he repeated false claims that the election “was stolen from us” and that it was a “fraudulent election,” before telling the violent mob, “So go home, we love you, you’re very special.”“President Trump on Wednesday evening openly condoned on social media the violence unfolding at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue after a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol, prompting Facebook and Twitter to remove his posts and lock his accounts.” — The New York TimesPart II: Should President Trump be removed from office?Bret Stephens writes in a Times Op-Ed essay:“The duty of the House of Representatives and the Senate, once they certify Joe Biden’s election, is to reconvene immediately to impeach the president and then remove him from office and bar him from ever holding office again.To allow Trump to serve out his term, however brief it may be, puts the nation’s safety at risk, leaves our reputation as a democracy in tatters and evades the inescapable truth that the assault on Congress was an act of violent sedition aided and abetted by a lawless, immoral and terrifying president.”Some business leaders, members of Congress and members of the president’s own cabinet are wondering whether the president is unfit to hold office, even for the remaining two weeks of his term.Based on the answers you gave to Part I above, do you think Mr. Trump is no longer fit to serve as president? Is he a danger to the country? What do you think would be the benefits of invoking the 25th Amendment, which provides procedures to replace a sitting president who is no longer capable of fulfilling his duties, or in initiating impeachment proceedings in an attempt to remove Mr. Trump from office? What might be the downsides?Finally, what do you think will happen? Do you think Mr. Trump will face any consequences for his role in encouraging a mob attack at the Capitol?What happens when a president refuses to accept the results of a free and fair election? What happens when 147 members of Congress in his party repeat the president’s unsubstantiated claims and object to the outcome of the election? Is democracy in danger?Watch the five-minute video above, from 2018, which analyzes the rise and fall of democratic governments around the world, and looks at the strengths and weaknesses of democracy in the United States. Then read the Nov. 11 article “Trump’s Post-Election Tactics Put Him in Unsavory Company” and answer the following questions:What tactics are leaders using to kill democracy in their countries?What forces can turn people against democracy?What evidence is there that a retreat from democracy might be happening in the United States?The article’s author compares Mr. Trump’s post-election tactics with those of dictators around the world. In what ways do Mr. Trump’s actions parallel those of authoritarian leaders? In what ways are they different?What is at stake for democracy — both in the United States and around the world — when a president refuses to comply with a peaceful transfer of power?On Jan. 7 President Trump released a new video addressing the violence at the Capitol and saying “a new administration” will be sworn in. He stated, “My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power. This moment calls for healing and reconciliation.” Does Mr. Trump’s statement a day after the attack at the U.S. Capitol make you feel any differently about the strength of American democracy?The Capitol Police were clearly outnumbered and unprepared for the onslaught on Jan. 6, writes The Times in “Capitol Breach Draws Sharp Condemnation of Law Enforcement.” It took more than two hours, and reinforcements from other law enforcement agencies, before order was restored.But as the world watched live on television, many, including President-elect Joe Biden, noted that these Trump supporters were treated less harshly by law enforcement than other groups, especially protesters who are Black or are protesting on behalf of racial justice, have been. As the article reports:… protesters on the left saw a stark double standard, saying they had been hit with rubber bullets, manhandled, surrounded and arrested while behaving peacefully during demonstrations against racial injustice over the summer.Attica Scott, a state representative in Kentucky, was arrested in Louisville on felony charges that were later dropped during the many months of protest over the death of Breonna Taylor in a botched police raid. “You can be arrested for walking while Black,” she said, “but you can be white and riot and basically get away with it.”The Op-Ed columnist Nicholas Kristof echoes this, pointing out:Trump and his enablers talk a good game about patriotism. They denounced President Barack Obama for sometimes not wearing a flag lapel pin. They criticized Colin Kaepernick for protesting police brutality by taking a knee rather than standing during the national anthem — and then Trump incited a mob on Wednesday to invade the United States Capitol. The rioters encountered a minimal police response, not the kind that Black Lives Matter protesters received.Many of those pro-Trump rioters probably dispute the idea of white privilege. But the fact that they were allowed to overrun the police and invade the Senate and House chambers was evidence of that privilege.“Capitol Rioters Walked Away. Climate Protesters Saw a Double Standard” quotes Bill McKibben, a writer and activist who said he has been arrested four times in Washington alone, and a half-dozen times at other protests, called nonviolent civil disobedience based on the examples of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Gandhi and the suffragists “one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century.” The comparatively lenient response to the overwhelmingly white protesters on Wednesday, he said, “was the epitome of white supremacy,” and a dangerous precedent for the future of protest in the United States. He said he feared that in the future, young activists would tell him when he advised a nonviolent path that “all the peace stuff you talk about, Rev and Bill, that doesn’t work.”“And that leads to destruction,” he said.You might discuss these articles with students, using questions like these:Do you agree with the many who saw a “stark double standard”? Was the response by police evidence of white privilege? Was it “the epitome of white supremacy”?What have you seen or read in the news, past or present, or experienced in your own life that bolsters your opinion?If you believe there was a double standard, what should be done about it? Why? What should be the consequences for those who invaded the Capitol, damaged federal property, halted Congress’s constitutional duties and endangered lives?Look at how Mr. McKibben and others compare peaceful civil disobedience to what happened on Jan. 6. Do you think he is right that the storming of the Capitol was “a dangerous precedent for the future of protest in the United States”? Many say what happened on Jan. 6 can be understood only in the context of the history of far-right extremist movements and the conspiracy theories that often fuel them. The Op-Ed columnist Charlie Wartzel writes in “The Pro-Trump Movement Was Always Headed Here”:For close observers of the pro-Trump and far-right extremist movements, this dark moment has felt almost inevitable. You can draw a straight line from the message-board fever swamps to Mr. Trump’s rallies to Charlottesville to “Stand back and stand by” to this. It is a desperate attempt to overthrow the democratic process. It is also the crash of a universe of toxic conspiracies against the rocks of human reality.In another Opinion piece, “The Far Right Told Us What It Had Planned. We Didn’t Listen,” Seyward Darby writes:This moment was a long time coming. Its origins predate President Trump encouraging his supporters to reject the election results and their planning — out in the open — to do so. It predates Mr. Trump taking office, or even considering a presidential run. As people who study right-wing extremism know well, the seeds of this attempted coup were sown decades ago.Ms. Darby points out: “History holds important lessons, if only we are willing to hear them. This moment — men and women breaching the Capitol’s barricades, entering the chambers of Congress and demanding the nullification of the presidential election based on nothing more than lies and conspiracy theories — is a culmination, but it is not an ending.”Students might read both articles, making note of what events, trends and failures each writer identifies that may have led to the storming of the Capitol. What topics might your students need to further investigate — from QAnon to the role of the news media to the history of white supremacy — to gain a fuller understanding of the roots of this event? Where might they find reliable information? And if this moment is “a culmination but it is not an ending,” what do they think needs to happen to prevent future moments like this?Reporters and journalists are tasked with covering high-stakes situations as they unfold. Because much of our news is consumed online, journalists have to make in-the-moment decisions about what they will share with readers and what language will best convey the story.Have students read the two tweets below from journalists who work for different news organizations and then share: What do they notice? What do they wonder? What message are these reporters trying to convey about media and language?Invite your students to think about the different words they have seen and heard used to describe the events at Capitol Hill and the people who perpetrated them.They might start by looking at the front page or home page of at least three sources. For example, they can look at local papers or national newspapers like The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times or The Chicago Tribune; or they can visit TV or radio news websites.Have them circle, highlight or write down the words used to describe what happened on Wednesday — words like “protesters,” “mob” and “insurrection” — and then reflect on what they noticed:What do these words mean? What particular connotations do they have?What other language choices did reporters make? For example, how do they use active versus passive voice?Why might these publications have made these specific choices? How does the language begin to frame a narrative of the attack on the Capitol?How do these choices compare with other protests, riots or acts of violence in the United States and abroad? What does that say about this particular event and the people involved?Do your students think the sources they explored made the right choices in the wording they used? Why or why not? If not, what words might they use instead?To take it a step further, you might invite them to compare and contrast the sources they explored. What similarities and differences do they notice? If they could write to the editors, what questions would they ask about the language that was used?What role does the news media have in historical moments like this one?If you teach students who read multiple languages or you teach internationally, you can invite them to do this same activity by looking at headlines from around the world in “America’s Friends and Foes Express Horror as Capitol Attack ‘Shakes the World’” and “A Shattering Blow to America’s Troubled Democratic Image.”Part I: Explore how social media was deployed in organizing the attack.What role did social media play in the assault on the Capitol? What responsibility do social media companies like Facebook, Twitter, Parler and Gab bear in facilitating it?In a live update from Jan. 6, Sheera Frenkel wrote:Calls for violence against members of Congress and for pro-Trump movements to retake the Capitol building have been circulating online for months. Bolstered by Mr. Trump, who has courted fringe movements like QAnon and the Proud Boys, groups have openly organized on social media networks and recruited others to their cause.On Wednesday, their online activism became real-world violence, leading to unprecedented scenes of mobs freely strolling through the halls of Congress and uploading celebratory photographs of themselves, encouraging others to join them.Identify some of the platforms, groups and strategies used by the president’s supporters to organize their storming of the U.S. Capitol. How did social media allow President Trump’s supporters to effectively coordinate? Do social media companies have a responsibility to intervene when their platforms are being used to plan and execute violence? And given that President Trump’s own tweets preceded the violence, do you believe these companies should pay extra attention to messages that world leaders post online, and their possible implications — or should they be treated the same as posts shared by anyone else?Part II: Evaluate how social media companies should respond.After the violence at the Capitol, Facebook suspended Mr. Trump’s account at least through the end of his term, and Twitter temporarily suspended his account — and issued a warning that any further violation of its rules could result in a permanent suspension. Kevin Roose writes:For years, top executives at social media companies treated President Trump with kid gloves, contorting themselves into pretzels to explain why he was still allowed to post on their platforms despite violating their rules again and again. Fearful of provoking a backlash from the president and his allies, they gave gauzy speeches defending free expression, wrote special policies to justify their inaction and attached weak warning labels to his posts.But Wednesday’s rampage at the Capitol — and perhaps the knowledge, solidified earlier in the day, that Democrats will soon control both houses of Congress — appears to have stiffened some spines.If you were the C.E.O. of a social media company, how would you respond? Draft a statement for your company detailing what actions you are planning to take and why. Consider the following questions:Are social media companies responsible for moderating posts that may incite violence? Or is it the responsibility of users?Do you think Mr. Trump should be allowed to have accounts on these platforms? Do you think that removing his posts or his accounts altogether is a justifiable limit on free speech? Does allowing him to have accounts threaten democracy or public safety?What are the possible downsides of suspending Mr. Trump’s accounts? If Mr. Trump remains barred by major social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, will he just find another platform that does not restrict his use?Update, Jan. 12: We invite students to respond to our Student Opinion prompt: “What Do You Think of the Decision by Tech Companies to Block President Trump?”Part I: Learn the history of sedition.On Twitter, the American Historical Association writes that “teaching today’s events — which are not a ‘moment,’ but the product of a long history — presents a familiar, yet unusually urgent, challenge: How can students use historical knowledge and thinking to understand the present?”One way is to study the history of sedition — a word that was on the lips of many as a mob stormed the Capitol on Wednesday. What is sedition exactly? When has it been invoked throughout American history and why? Who has been charged with sedition previously — and who hasn’t?Students can explore those questions and more in the Times article “‘Sedition’: A Complicated History.” As they read, invite them to compare what happened on Jan. 6 with other historical moments. What similarities do they see? What differences?The article ends by saying: “‘Sedition’ may have captured the moment yesterday. But some historians question whether it is the most illuminating verbal touchstone, given its own complicated history.”Have students weigh in: Would they consider what happened on Wednesday to be “sedition”? Should it be called something else? A coup? An insurrection? “Vigilante antidemocratic paramilitary violence,” as historian Greg Downs suggests in the article? How would they define it and why?For more historical connections, students might explore some of the texts in this Twitter thread from the American Historical Association.Part II: Help write future history books.After order was finally restored in the Capitol building, Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, said that “we can now add Jan. 6, 2021, to that very short list of dates in American history that will live forever in infamy,” invoking President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s phrase after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941.How do your students think this dramatic day will be remembered in history books? How should it be?Invite students to imagine that they are creating a print or digital textbook to help young people in future generations understand the events that took place on Jan. 6. What primary documents would they include — tweets, social media posts, newspaper articles, photos and videos? What would be the main themes or takeaways?

	<title>What Schumer’s Rise to Senate Majority Leader Means for New York</title>
	<author>Christina Goldbaum</author>
	<body>There has never been a Senate majority leader from New York, let alone one from Brooklyn.But after Democrats claimed razor-thin wins in a pair of Georgia runoffs, Senator Chuck Schumer will soon be taking charge of the legislative agenda in Washington’s upper chamber, and — by extension — place New York in line to reap the benefits.The state, in theory, should have already been in that position, but President Trump rarely adopted stances that benefited his former home state. That is expected to change with Mr. Schumer, with Democrats across New York thrilled to have a direct line to a man in charge of vitally needed federal aid and other assistance.“It is a bright sunny day in the State of New York,” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said in Albany on Wednesday morning. “The metaphorical sun is shining.”Mr. Schumer’s looming ascension was overshadowed when pro-Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in Washington, leaving the senator to deal with the fallout from the outgoing president rather than the promise of his successor.A lot. There is a long bipartisan tradition of majority leaders helping their home states out, whether it be through direct funding of projects, such as water plants in Mississippi, under the leadership of Trent Lott, a Republican, or more recently, the advocacy of Harry Reid, a Democrat, to sell off public lands and allow Nevada to use the profits for improvements.In Washington, Senator Mitch McConnell, a Republican, is primarily known for his uncanny ability to keep his conference in line and on schedule, delivering major victories for Mr. Trump on tax reform, the confirmation of three Supreme Court justices, and, of course, the president’s acquittal on impeachment charges last year.But the outgoing majority leader was also known for bringing money to his home state of Kentucky, which regularly ranks as one of the top “taker states” in the nation — meaning that it receives far more federal assistance than it provides in tax revenue.In late 2019, Mr. McConnell claimed to have brought $1 billion to Kentucky as part of two end-of-year spending bills, with money for everything from a veterans hospital in Louisville to a “forage animal production lab” devoted to horses and cattle at the University of Kentucky.Mr. Schumer, a diligent practitioner of old-fashioned politics, seems perfectly suited to carry on this tradition. He makes a habit of traveling to all of the state’s 62 counties every year and announcing ample servings of pork: $8 million for a Cornell lab, $81.5 million for the Rochester Institute of Technology, $14 million for Covid-19 efforts. And that was just since New Year’s Day.“I always fight for New York and always have,” Mr. Schumer said in an interview on Thursday evening. “It’s just in my bones.”With billions of dollars in budget deficits, Mr. Cuomo has been verbally battling for months with Mr. McConnell, who had suggested that he was not interested in offering a “blue state bailout.”Now, with Democrats in charge in Washington, those bailouts should be much easier to arrange, including the all-important issue of direct state and local aid, which was left out of the recent stimulus package. How much aid that will be remains to be seen, but in Albany, anything will help.The state could also get some relief from a personal bugbear of Mr. Cuomo’s: the cap on the federal deduction on state and local income taxes, which was passed as part of Mr. Trump’s 2017 tax reform bill. New York has some of the highest property tax rates in the country, and the cap limited how much could be written off.Mr. Cuomo has railed against the “S.A.L.T. cap” so often that it has become something of a running joke among the reporters who cover him, but Mr. Schumer has been equally opposed, saying that he wants it “dead, gone and buried.” He echoed that on Thursday, calling it a “nasty provision in the tax bill,” and calling its repeal “a very high priority.”Coupled with the victory of President-elect Joseph Biden, Mr. Schumer’s ascension may signal both new influence for New York on the national stage, as well as a new dynamic in the state’s internal power structure.Mr. Biden, for instance, is known to be friendly with Mr. Cuomo, though the relationship between the governor and Mr. Schumer is more fraught. Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat now in his 11th year in office, has long been the most powerful leader in the state; Mr. Schumer may now lay claim to that title.Whatever the ranking, the rivalry periodically flares up, including last year, when Mr. Cuomo — at the height of the first wave of the coronavirus in the state — took swipes at Mr. Schumer for what he felt was lackluster federal support.“It would be nice if he passed a piece of legislation that actually helped the State of New York,” the governor told reporters during one of his many Red Room news conferences.Mr. Schumer, a centrist like Mr. Cuomo, dismissed the governor’s critiques, reeling off support he’d brought home for small businesses, unemployed people, mass transit and hospitals. “Is it going to balance all of Cuomo’s budget? No. It’ll balance more than half of it,” Mr. Schumer said.On Wednesday, however, Mr. Cuomo congratulated Mr. Schumer, saying it “bodes well,” before outlining a series of things he’d like the new Congress to do. He suggested that the Senate had treated the state poorly over the last four years and could now “make it right.”For anyone who uses trains, subways or buses in New York, a Schumer-led Senate could be a godsend.In late December, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority received $4 billion as part of the stimulus deal to cover the agency’s shortfall through the end of 2021. But the M.T.A. still faces a nearly $8 billion deficit from 2022 through 2024, and transit officials have proposed slashing service to make up for that shortfall.Mr. Schumer’s new role — and additional federal funding — may stave off those cuts, as well as restart the agency’s $54 billion plan for badly needed upgrades to the ancient system.“Having him as leader of the chamber would be a benefit to the millions and millions of people in New York and across the country who rely on mass transportation,” said Patrick J. Foye, the M.T.A. chairman.The Biden administration is also expected to push forward New York’s congestion pricing scheme to charge drivers for entering the busiest parts of Manhattan, which is awaiting guidance from federal authorities on the environmental review process required for the plan to move forward. That plan is expected to generate $1 billion annually that will contribute to upgrades to the system.On Wednesday, before the mob descended on the Capitol, Mr. Schumer — anticipating the wins in Georgia — said that he intended to pursue more direct payments to Americans.“One of the first things that I want to do when our new senators are seated, is deliver the $2,000 checks,” Mr. Schumer said.On this point, amazingly, he was in alignment with Mr. Trump, who had stalled signing the December stimulus bill in hopes of getting bigger payments included. (The bill included $600 checks.) Yes, yes, and yes.Mr. Schumer has expressed support for decriminalizing marijuana on a federal level, saying his thinking had evolved over the years.“Here you had all these people saying, ‘Oh, it’s going to be horrible, it’s going to be horrible,’” the senator recalled in a chat with Representative Hakeem Jeffries, a fellow New Yorker. “Then several states legalized and the parade of horribles never occurred.”In this, Mr. Schumer could be running on a parallel track with Mr. Cuomo, who said on Wednesday that he would propose legalizing marijuana for recreational use in New York.Mr. Schumer and Mr. Cuomo will also find common ground on major transportation infrastructure projects, including the Gateway Project to fix the deteriorating rail tunnels under the Hudson River, which are expected to move forward under the Biden administration after languishing for years under Mr. Trump.“It could be the most important four years for New York’s transit system that ever existed,” said Nick Sifuentes, the executive director of Tri-State Transportation Campaign, an advocacy group.Mr. Schumer will also be overseeing the Senate’s unique power to confirm federal judges and Supreme Court justices. Mr. McConnell filled three Supreme Court seats and hundreds of vacancies in the federal judiciary, and only a few dozen remain open. Still, Mr. Schumer is promising “many more progressive judges,” as well as “creating much more diversity on the bench.”Mr. Schumer, 70, is up for re-election in 2022, and speculation has been swirling that he could face a serious primary challenge, perhaps even from Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the party’s progressive star.The precedent is certainly there for a viable challenge from the left; Ms. Ocasio-Cortez stunned the political world in June 2018 by defeating Joseph Crowley, then the No. 4 House Democrat. Last year saw another shocker, with the defeat of Eliot L. Engel, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, by a charismatic progressive challenger, Jamaal Bowman. Despite all the seeming momentum from the progressive end of the Democratic Party, Mr. Schumer’s new role might tamp down the enthusiasm for such a campaign, particularly if he is able to save New York’s finances by bringing a major bailout to the state.“He will be in a position to bring significant sums of money at a time when the state and the city need it,” said Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran Democratic political consultant, adding, “Money is what’s going to talk in the next couple years in New York.”</body>

	<title>A Cascade of Crises</title>
	<author>David Leonhardt</author>
	<body>Want to get The Morning by email? Here’s the sign-up.In the four months between Franklin Roosevelt’s election and his 1933 inauguration, much of the world descended into chaos.Adolf Hitler took power in Germany, and the Reichstag — the Parliament building — burned. Japan quit the League of Nations. In the U.S., hundreds of banks shut down. Lynchings surged in the South. “The country, numb and nearly broken, anxiously awaited deliverance,” as David Kennedy wrote in his Pulitzer Prize-winning history of the era.Today, the length of time between a presidential election and inauguration is about six weeks shorter than it was in 1933, and neither the U.S. nor the world is in as dire a situation as it was then. But the current situation is still pretty dire.The worst pandemic in a century is becoming more severe, with a contagious new coronavirus variant spreading and thousands of Americans dying every day. The mass vaccination program is behind schedule. Almost 10 million fewer Americans have jobs than did a year ago. The U.S. president, with the backing of dozens of members of Congress, has tried to overturn an election result and remain in power. Hundreds of his supporters overwhelmed police officers and stormed the Capitol, one of the few times in history that a U.S. government building has been violently attacked.All the while, the country lacks a president who has both the power and willingness to reduce the death, illness and mayhem.Instead, President-elect Joe Biden is left to rue that President Trump is denying the new government access to important national security information — and to plead with Trump to renounce the violence. Trump, for his part, appears disengaged from the worsening coronavirus crisis.Most other longtime democracies have much shorter lags between an election and the transfer of power. In Britain, a new government usually takes office the next day. In Canada, France, India and Japan, it happens within a few weeks.The authors of the U.S. Constitution created the delay to give a new government time to travel to the nation’s capital during winter, an issue that obviously no longer applies. And the country has already shortened the time period once, through the 20th Amendment. It was ratified in early 1933, during the chaotic months when Roosevelt was waiting to take office, but not soon enough to shorten his transition.Many legal scholars say there is little justification for today’s two-and-a-half-month wait. Sanford Levinson of the University of Texas has called it the Constitution’s “most mischievous” feature.“There is something profoundly troubling,” Levinson wrote in an academic journal in 1995, “in allowing repudiated presidents to continue to exercise the prerogatives of what is usually called ‘the most powerful political office in the world.’”Top congressional Democrats are demanding Trump’s removal from power.Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer said that Democrats were prepared to impeach Trump a second time. But with less than two weeks until the end of the president’s term, it’s unclear whether Democrats could move quickly enough to do so.Several Trump administration officials have resigned over the violence at the Capitol, including Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, and Elaine Chao, the transportation secretary. Here’s the list.The Justice Department did not rule out pursuing charges against Trump for his possible role in inciting the mob. “We are looking at all actors, not only the people who went into the building,” Michael Sherwin, the U.S. attorney in Washington, said.Trump has suggested to aides that he wants to pardon himself in the final days of his presidency. No president has pardoned himself before, and legal scholars are divided about whether the courts would recognize it.In a video on Twitter, Trump did not give up his false claims of election fraud, but finally conceded defeat.Facebook is blocking Trump’s account at least until the end of his term. “We believe the risks of allowing the president to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great,” Mark Zuckerberg said.The chief of the Capitol Police and the sergeants-at-arms for the House and Senate announced their resignations. Officials told The Times that the Capitol Police turned down support from the National Guard before Wednesday and rebuffed help from the F.B.I. as the mob descended.Brian Sicknick, a Capitol Police officer, has died from his injuries.A portrait is taking shape of Ashli Babbitt, who died in the rampage.There were infamous white nationalists and noted conspiracy theorists, while others were more anonymous. These are the rioters who rampaged the halls of Congress. The U.S. recorded more than 4,000 deaths from the virus yesterday. Dr. Anthony Fauci said the high toll was likely to continue and probably reflected increased travel and gatherings over the holidays. “We believe things will get worse as we get into January,” he said.A vaccine by the Chinese company Sinovac Biotech has an efficacy rate of 78 percent, researchers said. other big storiesBoeing will pay $2.5 billion to resolve a Justice Department investigation into safety issues with its 737 MAX plane.Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, is now the richest person in the world, ahead of Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.A reverse Great Migration: The Times columnist Charles Blow recently moved to Atlanta from New York, part of a rising number of Black Americans relocating to the South. He arrived in time to see Georgia elect its first Black U.S. senator, and describes the new migration as “the most audacious power play by Black America.”Also in Opinion: Gabby Giffords, a former member of Congress, writes about the 10th anniversary of the attempt to assassinate her — and about this week’s attack on the Capitol.Modern Love: A couple struggling with a cancer diagnosis improvises a wedding and joins a commune.Lives Lived: Neil Sheehan, who in 1971 obtained the Pentagon Papers, telling the secret government history of the Vietnam War, has died at 84. Sheehan, who covered the war for The Times, never explained how he got the documents — until a few years ago, when he agreed to an interview on the condition that it not be published until his death.Much of the country will watch the start of the N.F.L. playoffs this weekend. (Last year, the five most watched U.S. television shows of any kind were N.F.L. playoff games.) Here’s a primer — whether you’re a fan or just want to understand what people are talking about:Was this a normal season? Yes and no. The league played all 256 scheduled regular-season games, though sometimes with delays and missing players. The biggest absence this weekend: The Cleveland Browns will be missing their head coach, who tested positive for the coronavirus this week.What are the big playoff story lines? The Kansas City Chiefs are trying to become the first repeat champion in 16 years. The New England Patriots, without their longtime star Tom Brady, are out of the playoffs for the first time in 12 seasons. And Brady, despite being 43, has made it to the postseason on his new team, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.Which team should you root for if you don’t already have one? The Buffalo Bills are a good option. Buffalo, which hasn’t won a sports title in more than 50 years, loves its Bills. The young quarterback, Josh Allen, “makes for great television with deep throws and bruising runs,” as our colleague Benjamin Hoffman says. “It’s hard not to pull for the Bills.”How can I impress my football-fan friends? Ask whether they think home-field advantage still matters. With few or no fans in the stands, home teams lost slightly more games than they won this season. That had never happened before in modern football, as The Ringer’s Nora Princiotti notes.For football fans: The Times answers eight higher-level questions.Set aside some time to make this rich and complex beef stew.The final episode of “Jeopardy!” with Alex Trebek as host will air tonight. To mark the occasion, The Times’s Julia Jacobs interviewed Johnny Gilbert, the 92-year-old announcer who introduced Trebek on air for 36 years.For the first time in half a decade, a full year went by without a new “Star Wars” to hit the big screen.

	<title>Hispanic unemployment shot up in the latest report.</title>
	<author>Jeanna Smialek</author>
	<body>Unemployment rates for Hispanic workers shot up in December, even as the jobless rate moderated for Black workers and held roughly steady for whites, showing that the costs of recent job losses were being felt unevenly across demographic groups.The Hispanic or Latino unemployment rate jumped to 9.3 percent from 8.4 percent in November, partly reversing a rapid recovery since the figure popped to 18.9 percent in April. Before the pandemic, the Hispanic jobless rate was hovering around 4.4 percent.At the same time, the Black unemployment rate continued a gradual decline, falling to 9.9 percent in December from 10.3 percent the month before. Unemployment for Black workers didn’t jump quite as high early in the pandemic — it peaked at 16.7 percent in April and May — but it has been easing more slowly than Hispanic joblessness.A major concern throughout the pandemic has been the economic burden falling on those with the fewest resources to weather it. Job losses have been heavy in service businesses, particularly in relatively low-wage occupations that disproportionately employ racial and ethnic minorities.White workers have been faring better than other groups. Their unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 6 percent in December, from 5.9 percent in November, but is down from a peak of 14.1 percent last year. Still, that is about twice the 3 percent rate last February.Asian workers are also doing comparatively well, with their unemployment rate at 5.9 percent in December, though that’s up from 2.4 percent in February.</body>

	<title>How New York’s Representatives Voted After the Capitol Riot</title>
	<author>Amanda Rosa</author>
	<body> [Want to get New York Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.]It’s Friday. Weather:  Mostly sunny, with a high in the low 40s. Much the same over the weekend, but a bit chillier and gusty on Saturday. Alternate-side parking: In effect until Jan. 18 (Martin Luther King Jr. Day). When members of Congress were evacuated from the Capitol in Washington and sheltered in undisclosed locations Wednesday afternoon, New York’s 26 sitting representatives and two senators were among them.Hours later, they returned, and Congress confirmed President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s win.Four New York representatives were among the 147 Republicans who voted to overturn the election results, despite the lack of evidence for President Trump’s baseless claims of widespread fraud: Nicole Malliotakis, who represents Staten Island and part of South Brooklyn; Lee Zeldin from Long Island; Elise M. Stefanik, who represents the North Country; and Chris Jacobs from the Buffalo area. (Both of the state’s senators are Democrats who voted to certify the election results.)This is how four members of the New York delegation voted and reacted to the violence:Freshman Ritchie Torres, a Democrat who represents the Bronx, voted to certify the election results.On Wednesday morning as he walked toward the Capitol, he took a video of pro-Trump protesters, referring to them as “saboteurs of democracy.” At 1:25 p.m., he said he was ordered to evacuate the Cannon building, where his office is.“Life never unfolds quite as you imagine it,” he said on Twitter. “I never thought, as a newly sworn-in Congressman, that I would live through a violent assault on the US Capitol during an Electoral College vote count.”Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a progressive Democrat who represents parts of the Bronx and Queens, voted to certify the election after she was “barricaded in for several hours” during the riot.She quickly called for the cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment and backed articles of impeachment to remove the president, which were drafted by Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. New York representatives Jamaal Bowman and Mondaire Jones have called for impeachment as well.Ms. Malliotakis, a staunch supporter of the president, voted against certifying the election, even though Mr. Trump’s claims of malfeasance have been repeatedly rejected by numerous state officials of both parties, as well as by dozens of judges, across the country.She is a freshman Republican in the House of Representatives who defeated the incumbent Democrat Max Rose in November. Her district is the most conservative in New York City.During the melee, Capitol Police brought Ms. Malliotakis and her staff to a secure location, she tweeted. She condemned the violence as “un-American” and called for rioters to be prosecuted.“Yesterday was my third day, and I feel like I’ve been here for three years, quite frankly,” she said on Fox News.Mr. Zeldin, a conservative Republican who represents Long Island, voted to overturn the election results and said many of his constituents were “demanding that I voice their objections here today.”“This debate is necessary because rogue election officials, secretaries of state and courts circumvented state election laws,” he said while speaking on the floor of the House.Judges and officials of both parties in contested swing states have strenuously disagreed, calling such assertions unfounded and saying that the laws were followed.Before speaking, Mr. Zeldin pleaded with protesters to “listen to our great Capitol Police who need to get control immediately.”[Read more: Protesters in New York urged the ouster of President Trump.]What Schumer’s Rise to Senate Majority Leader Means for New YorkWoman Who Tackled Black Teenager at SoHo Hotel Is ArrestedPreserving New York’s Ties to the Underground RailroadJean Valentine, Minimalist Poet With Maximum Punch, Dies at 86Want more news?

	<title>Help! Despite State Travel Restrictions, I Can’t Get My Ski Pass Refunded</title>
	<author>Sarah Firshein</author>
	<body>I live in Massachusetts and had hoped to ski at Okemo Mountain Resort as much as possible this year. However, in November, Vermont announced a new set of cross-state travel guidelines, which include a mandatory quarantine that makes it all-but-impossible to visit regularly throughout the winter. Despite a blitz of preseason assurances of risk-free booking on seasonal ski passes, Vail Resorts, Okemo’s parent company, is refusing to issue pass refunds for people facing state quarantine requirements. The silence is telling: Where’s the corporate responsibility? RobYour travel predicament — about an outdoor, socially distanced activity, the issue of quarantines and the inability to get a refund — is just about as “2020” (whoops, 2021) as it gets.Ski resorts around the country are open this year, but despite a slew of new safety measures including increased cleaning, capacity limits, timed tickets and off-limits indoor dining, they are not faring well. In an earnings call in December, Vail Resorts announced a net revenue decrease of 51 percent for its first quarter fiscal-year 2021 (the three months ending Oct. 31, 2020).Vail Resorts, one of the biggest players in the ski industry, has more than 30 resorts across 15 states. Eight of those states, Vermont included, currently have quarantine or testing mandates — and sometimes a combination of both — for out-of-state travelers.According to Ted Brady, the deputy secretary of the Vermont Agency Commerce and Community Development, Vermont’s new travel restrictions — which require a 14-day quarantine or a seven-day quarantine plus a negative PCR test, either completed at home or in Vermont — have reduced the number of skiers and snowboarders coming into the state this year. He said resorts reported a 50-to-70 percent decline in bookings over the holiday season.“The State of Vermont issued some of the strictest ski resort guidance in the country,” Mr. Brady said in an emailed statement. “Most notably, this guidance requires all guests to attest that they meet the quarantine requirements and understand that failing to do so could result in the loss of their skiing and riding privileges.”Vail Resorts’ individual, date-specific lift tickets, rentals and ski-and-ride school lessons are easily refundable. As early as April, the company also announced that its historically nonrefundable Epic Pass, a seasonal pass program, would automatically come with free Epic Coverage, a refund policy that offers protection for a set list of qualifying incidents.Epic Coverage grants full or prorated pass refunds in situations like resort closures and personal events like job loss or injury. Mandatory stay-at-home orders in the pass holder’s county, state or country of residence are also covered. Yet state travel advisories are not.Regional Epic Passes allow skiers and snowboarders to access several mountains over the course of the season. For instance, the Northeast Midweek Pass — the one you purchased, which cost around $450 when it was on sale last year — grants access to 17 resorts in New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Vermont. All of those states currently have travel restrictions, as does your home state of Massachusetts.In a statement, a Vail Resorts spokeswoman said, “While Vermont’s quarantine requirements may present challenges for some pass holders, they do not prohibit pass holders from accessing our mountains. State and local orders are very fluid. These requirements could be changed again, or even eliminated, as soon as next month.”She added, “We certainly apologize for any confusion, but we were intentional in specifying ‘mandatory stay-at-home orders’ versus ‘travel restrictions’ on our website and in communications with guests.”You aren’t alone in feeling like that’s an unfair stipulation. Tim Morse, a New York–based Epic Pass holder, had hoped to go back and forth to Mount Snow in Vermont this winter. A firefighter and parent of two children who attend in-person school five days a week, he is unable to quarantine before every ski weekend.Given the rising infection rates, he doubts that Vermont’s travel restrictions will lift anytime soon and worries about ski season effectively being over by the time that happens (if that happens).“I could very easily go to Mount Snow and just say that I’ve quarantined,” Mr. Morse said when I called him this week. “But that is not helping solve this issue. That is why the numbers are as bad as they are.” He feels that Vail Resorts is punishing pass holders who are trying to do the right thing, he added.Although Epic Coverage is technically a refund policy, and not insurance, Vail Resorts’ stance — that adhering to state travel advisories is a willful decision that consumers must make for themselves — tracks with the insurance industry’s view. “In general, state quarantine requirements, while inconvenient, do not prevent a trip from taking place as technically the traveler is still able to reach their destination,” said Megan Moncrief, the chief marketing officer at Squaremouth, a travel insurance-comparison website.Mr. Morse said he’s open to rolling forward his Epic Pass to next ski season — a popular middle ground for travel companies during the pandemic. Although Vail Resorts offered last season’s pass holders credits of at least 20 percent and up to 80 percent when the pandemic cut short the season in March, that isn’t currently an option for this season’s pass holders.“We have not announced any credit program for the 2020/21 season, but we will be reviewing the season in total and will assess how to retain the loyalty of pass holders, given the unique circumstances of this season,” the spokeswoman said.Mr. Brady, of the Agency of Commerce and Community Development, said he has noticed that most pass deferrals or refunds have generally not been from resorts with multistate, multi-mountain pass products. One notable exception is Alterra Mountain Company’s Ikon Pass, which grants access to 44 ski resorts, including Sugarbush Resort in Vermont. The program’s Adventure Assurance policy allows unused passes to be rolled forward to next season.But how to handle the shifting nature of state travel restrictions is not an issue specific to ski resorts. When California banned nonessential out-of-state travel last month, some would-have-been Airbnb guests were left fighting, unsuccessfully, for refunds.On the East Coast, after booking a three-night stay for the presidential inauguration at Moxy Washington, D.C. Downtown, Michelle Ai learned she could not actually attend the inauguration: in deference to the Presidential Inaugural Committee’s warning against travel to Washington, her senator’s office is not giving out tickets.Ms. Ai spent several weeks battling with the hotel, which is largely sticking to its policies about nonrefundable prepaid rates, until she finally accepted a voucher for a five-night stay to be used within the first half of the year.Meanwhile, at The St. Regis Washington, D.C., which, like Moxy, is a Marriott hotel, guests can cancel without penalty up to seven days before arrival.But back to those slopes. The Facebook ski groups I’ve been lurking in are abuzz with reports of impossible-to-crack Vail Resorts customer-service lines and refund requests that seemingly go nowhere. There’s also a palpable sense of bewilderment and outrage. As one New Hampshire–based nurse said to me on the phone this week: “This is an active thing happening everywhere in the United States. Who among us doesn’t know what’s going on?”In an email, the Vail Resorts spokeswoman said, “The challenges everyone is facing amid this pandemic, our resorts included, are tremendous — and we sincerely understand the frustrations. Because it is a season-long product, and travel restrictions are constantly changing, we will take all of that into consideration and review how the remainder of the season transpires in thinking about how we retain the loyalty of guests such as those you describe.”To date, Vail Resorts has not provided refunds to pass holders — including you, Rob — because of cross-state travel restrictions.Which leaves me thinking about something you wrote in an email: “Beyond my own refund, it’s a bit heartbreaking for those on the front lines trying to keep their heads above water, even as so many disregard public guidelines.”Sarah Firshein is a Brooklyn-based writer.

	<title>Trump thanks Republicans for their ‘loyalty’ in upbeat video about the 2020 election.</title>
	<author>Maggie Haberman</author>
	<body>President Trump recorded a two-minute video on Thursday that was played at the Republican National Committee winter meeting that evening, in which he spoke only in upbeat terms about the 2020 election and thanked the committee members for their “loyalty.”The video came at a time when several Republicans in the Senate and some in the House, as well as former administration officials, are seeking to distance themselves from Mr. Trump after a crowd of supporters quickly went from listening to an inflammatory speech he made on Wednesday to a deadly mob overtaking the Capitol.Mr. Trump had been considering another campaign of his own in 2024, something many Republican officials now see as an impossibility after the violence on Wednesday.The president never mentioned the violence during the video to the Republican committee, and he also stayed away from the conspiracy theories and false claims of widespread fraud about the election that he had been spreading for two months.In the video, Mr. Trump thanks “all my incredible friends at the R.N.C.,” the committee where his loyalist, Ronna McDaniel, is expected to be re-elected for another two-year term. He talked about receiving millions more votes than he did in 2016, the number of Republican women who were elected to Congress as well as the coronavirus vaccine.“I want to thank you for your friendship and your loyalty,” he said.</body>

	<title>México: hombres armados irrumpieron en un velorio y mataron al menos a nueve personas</title>
	<author>Oscar Lopez</author>
	<body>CIUDAD DE MÉXICO — Al menos nueve personas fueron asesinadas en el centro de México, cuando unos hombres armados abrieron fuego durante un velorio la noche del jueves, según informaron las autoridades locales. Las imágenes en las redes sociales mostraban cuerpos ensangrentados esparcidos cerca de un ataúd y personas que se habían desplomado en la calle.El tiroteo tuvo lugar en el exterior de una casa particular en la ciudad de Celaya, en el estado de Guanajuato, según las autoridades locales, que dijeron que una persona herida había sido llevada a un hospital. Algunos medios de comunicación locales informaron que el número de muertos podría llegar a ser de 13.El ataque ocurrió alrededor de las 9 p.m. en el barrio Arboledas de San Rafael. Las fuerzas de seguridad buscan a los responsables, según la Secretaría de Seguridad Ciudadana, una agencia local en Celaya.En los videos difundidos en las redes sociales se escuchan ráfagas de disparos que parecían haber sido grabados en la escena.El ataque es el más reciente que ha asolado Guanajuato, alguna vez una región relativamente pacífica, que ahora se encuentra en el centro de una guerra territorial entre grupos criminales rivales.El estado, hogar de destinos turísticos como San Miguel de Allende, se ha convertido últimamente en uno de los más mortíferos em México. En julio, 26 personas fueron asesinadas después de que hombres armados irrumpieron en un centro de rehabilitación de adicción a las drogas en la ciudad de Irapuato, otro en una serie de ataques violentos que han tenido lugar en gran parte del país.Guanajuato, núcleo de fabricación de automóviles al noroeste de Ciudad de México, tuvo un promedio de por lo menos nueve homicidios al día en 2020, una de las tasas de asesinato más altas del país.El derramamiento de sangre en Guanajuato es en gran parte el resultado de una disputa territorial entre el cártel de Santa Rosa de Lima y el Cártel Jalisco Nueva Generación, más grande y poderoso, que ha expandido sus operaciones a Guanajuato. Este conflicto ha llevado a un aumento de la violencia y a varios asesinatos en masa.“Es una situación muy grave lo que se está padeciendo en Guanajuato”, dijo el presidente de México, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, en una conferencia de prensa tras la masacre de julio. “Sí hay una confrontación de bandas y son agresiones entre ellos en la mayoría de los casos”.A pesar de la promesa de entregar la paz con “abrazos, no balazos”, López Obrador no ha podido mellar significativamente en la creciente violencia de México. Más de 31.000 personas fueron asesinadas entre enero y noviembre del año pasado, según cifras oficiales.En diciembre, un exgobernador del estado de Jalisco, Aristóteles Sandoval, fue asesinado a tiros mientras estaba de vacaciones en la ciudad turística de Puerto Vallarta, en uno de los asesinatos políticos de más alto perfil de la historia reciente de México. Los expertos en seguridad dijeron que el cártel de Nueva Generación de Jalisco era probablemente el culpable.El asesinato de Sandoval se produjo pocos meses después de un descarado intento de asesinar al jefe de policía de México, que también fue vinculado al cártel de Jalisco.</body>

	<title>Here’s what Trump’s cabinet members have said about the storming of the Capitol.</title>
	<author>Chris Cameron</author>
	<body>All of President Trump’s cabinet secretaries condemned the violent mob that stormed the Capitol building on Wednesday. Some pointed to the president for inciting the violence, and two cabinet members resigned. Here’s what they said:Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a statement released hours after the melee, said, “The storming of the U.S. Capitol today is unacceptable. Lawlessness and rioting — here or around the world — is always unacceptable.”Jeffrey A. Rosen, the acting attorney general, called the violence “an intolerable attack on a fundamental institution of our democracy” in a statement on Wednesday. On Thursday, Mr. Rosen added that law enforcement officials were working to find, arrest and charge those who breached the Capitol.“The Department of Justice is committed to ensuring that those responsible for this attack on our government and the rule of law face the full consequences of their actions.“We will continue to methodically assess evidence, charge crimes and make arrests in the coming days and weeks to ensure that those responsible are held accountable under the law.”Christopher C. Miller, the acting defense secretary, wrote in a statement on Thursday that he supported a “peaceful transition of power to President-elect Biden on Jan. 20.”“Yesterday’s violence at the Capitol was reprehensible and contrary to the tenets of the United States Constitution.”Education Secretary Betsy DeVos resigned on Thursday night. She condemned the violence in the immediate aftermath on Wednesday, writing that “an angry mob cannot be allowed to attack our Capitol.”“The peaceful transfer of power is what separates American representative democracy from banana republics.“The work of the people must go on.”Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao resigned on Thursday. She was the first cabinet official to join a growing exodus of administration officials in the final days of the Trump presidency.“Our country experienced a traumatic and entirely avoidable event as supporters of the president stormed the Capitol building following a rally he addressed,” Ms. Chao wrote in a letter posted on Twitter. “It has deeply troubled me in a way that I simply cannot set aside.”Chad F. Wolf, the acting homeland security secretary, denounced the president’s supporters who participated in the riot and called on Mr. Trump to more forcefully condemn them.“What transpired yesterday was tragic and sickening,” Mr. Wolf wrote in a statement posted on Twitter. “We now see some supporters of the president using violence as a means to achieve political ends.”Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will remain in his post and carry out his responsibilities until the inauguration, according to a person familiar with his thinking. Mr. Mnuchin, who was traveling in Israel on Thursday, condemned the violence but made no mention of the president. “These actions are unacceptable and must stop,” he said.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross tweeted a six-word statement in the hours after the riot on Wednesday: “Violence is never the proper solution.”Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette condemned what he called a “tragic event in our Nation’s Capitol.”“Politically-motivated violence, regardless of ideology or cause, must always be condemned in the strongest possible terms,” he wrote on Twitter. “No American should excuse wanton disregard for one of our Nation’s most sacred institutions.”Health Secretary Alex M. Azar II wrote on Twitter that “people must immediately and peacefully disperse.”“I am disgusted by the attack on the Capitol we witnessed today. Physical violence and the desecration of this hallowed symbol of our democracy must end.”Housing Secretary Ben Carson also posted on Twitter calling for an end to the violence.“Violence is never an appropriate response regardless of legitimate concerns. Please remember: if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.”Interior Secretary David Bernhardt condemned the violence and praised the actions of the U.S. Park Police, an agency in his department, on Twitter on Wednesday.“Today’s violence and lawlessness at the U.S. Capitol cannot and will not be tolerated.”“Thank you U.S. Park Police for always fulfilling your selfless duties to safeguard lives and protect our symbols of democracy.”Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia on Wednesday called the attack “a low point in the history of our democracy. We must immediately rise above this.”Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said to reporters in Georgia that he was “disappointed” in the president for inciting the mob, adding it “was not the right thing to do.”“I’m very discouraged by the people who were there that felt compelled to breach the Capitol and do the things they did.”“We’re going to go forward as America. We have a new president.”Robert L. Wilkie, the secretary of veterans affairs, wrote on Twitter Friday: “Our #Veterans fought to defend the freedoms that were attacked this week. The assault on the Capitol is an affront to all who have worn the uniform.”</body>

	<title>Republicans Reel as Democrats Seethe</title>
	<author>Giovanni Russonello</author>
	<body>A day after professing his “love” for them, Trump condemns the supporters who ransacked the Capitol. It’s Friday, and this is your politics tip sheet. Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.Just a few weeks ago, President Trump had lost the presidential election — whether he admitted it or not — but it still looked as if he had pulled off a remarkable feat: His take-no-prisoners, reality-bending style as the Republican Party’s leader had been at least somewhat vindicated by the results on Nov. 3.With him at the top of the ticket, Republican turnout had surged, allowing G.O.P. candidates down the ballot to avoid the major losses that many had predicted. The Trump campaign’s strategy of driving up turnout among working-class white voters, including many who hadn’t voted in past elections, seemed to have paid off — at least enough to light a path forward for the Republican Party.The events of this week have turned all that sideways. The Senate has now flipped Democratic, after Georgia’s Republican senators lost runoff elections marred by Trump’s squabbles with the state’s Republican leaders.And then on Wednesday, in what will go down as a dark day in the country’s history, Trump directed a flock of his supporters to march on the Capitol and “show strength.” Hundreds stormed the building and ransacked the Senate chamber, in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent Congress from ratifying Joe Biden’s legitimate election victory.The chaos left five people dead, including a Capitol Police officer whose passing was announced late last night, as the nation looked on aghast. All of a sudden, Trump’s grip on the party appeared to be loosening. So where does that leave Republican leaders?In a word, uncomfortable. Shaken by Wednesday’s violence — and well aware of how damaging the rampage could be to the party’s reputation among more moderate voters — a number of Republicans in Congress backed off their support for Trump’s challenge to the election results.But nearly 150 G.O.P. lawmakers, including more than 100 in the House, did end up registering their objection to the Electoral College results, setting an extraordinary precedent.The reality is that Trump remains the most popular and influential public figure among Republican voters.Polls since November have consistently shown that most Republicans say they believe the president’s falsehoods about widespread election fraud — reflecting not only his personal influence, but also the willingness of his supporters to choose Trump-friendly narratives over faith in civic institutions. (Read Jeremy W. Peters’s short essay below, on how conservative pundits are already reframing Wednesday’s events to absolve Trump of blame.)Further complicating things is the fact that Biden has aggressively courted moderate Americans, including the kinds of suburbanites and center-right voters that the Republican Party had heavily relied upon just a decade ago.Many Republican officials now recognize that without the support of anti-institutional, white, working-class voters — who remain broadly loyal to Trump — they would be left without any base at all.Still, G.O.P. leaders are feeling the heat. After Wednesday’s melee, some prominent members of Trump’s administration resigned, including Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, and Elaine Chao, the transportation secretary and the wife of Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader.The resignations were essentially symbolic, since the administration will be around for only another 12 days, and they mostly felt like an attempt by those officials to wipe their hands clean and walk away after steadily standing at the president’s side for the past four years.Some observers have called upon members of Trump’s cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to strip him of his powers, and at least one House Republican said yesterday that he would back such a move.John Kelly, Trump’s estranged former chief of staff, said on CNN yesterday that if he were still in the cabinet, he would support using the 25th Amendment to oust Trump.Vice President Mike Pence, however, would oppose such an action, a person in his inner circle told Maggie Haberman. According to the text of the amendment, Pence and a majority of the cabinet would need to agree in order to remove Trump from power before Jan. 20.Teleprompter Trump is back. Heeding the outrage of the G.O.P.’s top brass, the president released a brief video address last night in which he read somberly from prepared remarks, belatedly committing himself to a peaceful transfer of power.Barely over 24 hours after he released a video expressing “love” for his supporters at the Capitol and calling them “very special people,” Trump declared himself “outraged by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem.”Contrary to reports that he had resisted sending in additional forces to take back the Capitol, Trump claimed that he had “immediately deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to secure the building.”By now, this cycle of binge and bust has become familiar: First, Trump breaks a norm of American governance. Then he stays mum while outrage ensues, seemingly basking in the confusion he has unleashed. Finally, after 24 hours or so, he offers a staid and well-rehearsed statement of compunction.The next step in the process usually involves Trump hopping back onto social media and picking up where he left off, lobbing bombs at his opponents and complaining about “unfair” treatment. But he may not have quite the same opportunity to do that this time.Facebook said yesterday that it would block Trump from using its platforms at least until he leaves office. Twitter had locked Trump out for nearly 24 hours, after he released his video on Wednesday praising supporters, although his access was later restored.With just a dozen days left until Biden’s inauguration, it appears Trump is finally allowing official transition business to take place.He issued a letter yesterday to his ambassadors and other political appointees, instructing them to step down — a move that a typical departing president would have undertaken weeks ago.The chief of the U.S. Capitol Police, Steven Sund, said yesterday that he would resign next week. A wide array of critics, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, had raised questions about why his officers weren’t better prepared for the attack on the Capitol.Many also pointed out that officers had appeared to stand aside while rioters ransacked the building, and they questioned why so many of the intruders had not been arrested.A bust of President Zachary Taylor in the Capitol building was covered yesterday after being defaced the day before.By Jeremy W. PetersTrump is far more isolated than at any prior moment in his presidency, abandoned by allies ranging from Republican senators to The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board after he provoked a violent siege at the Capitol this week.But it is far less certain how harshly his supporters will judge him for it.Beyond Congress, many of his allies in the conservative media and right-wing politics have largely absolved him of fault for the surreal and frightening attack.The president’s defenders downplayed the violence as acts of desperation by people who felt lied to by the news media and ignored by their elected representatives. They deflected by drawing false equivalencies about the Democratic Party’s embrace of the Black Lives Matter movement.Some even tried to dispute that Trump supporters were the perpetrators, suggesting without evidence that far-left activists had infiltrated the crowd.“To any insincere, fake DC ‘patriots’ used as PLANTS — you will be found out,” wrote Sarah Palin, the Republican Party’s vice-presidential nominee in 2008, who demanded that the news media look into the allegiances of the people who smashed their way into the Capitol.Palin’s surfacing amid the fury was a reminder that no matter how many Republican officials speak out against Trump’s dangerous insinuations, the party has often looked the other way as grass-roots activists and far-right leaders used militant language and imagery to rally their followers. An early figure in the Tea Party movement, Palin often summoned Revolutionary War metaphors and other phrases in her speeches and social media posts that led critics to accuse her of glorifying violence, like “Don’t retreat, reload.”Debating a criminal referral. The Jan. 6 House committee has grown divided over whether to make a criminal referral of former President Donald J. Trump to the Justice Department, even though it has concluded that it has enough evidence to do so. The debate centers on whether a referral would backfire by politically tainting the expanding federal investigation.Cooperating with investigators. Pat A. Cipollone and Patrick F. Philbi, two of Mr. Trump’s top White House lawyers, met with the Jan. 6 House committee, while Ali Alexander, a prominent organizer of pro-Trump events after the 2020 election, said he would assist in the federal investigation.Contempt charges. The House voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino Jr., two close allies of Mr. Trump, after the pair defied subpoenas from the special committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.Many Trump sympathizers tried to shift the focus away from the mob scene in Washington and revive months-old stories about the fires and looting that accompanied some protests over police brutality after the killing of George Floyd in May.The Fox News host Laura Ingraham urged people not to rush to judgment about the demonstrators as a whole — a kind of generosity she and many other conservatives hardly displayed when describing the millions of Americans who protested peacefully last summer. Ingraham described speaking to pro-Trump demonstrators on Wednesday “who are extremely upset that they are being lumped in with individuals who would break windows.”A good number of the president’s followers seem likely to continue to reward aggressive and over-the-line conduct — and even expect it — well after he leaves the White House.“He’s not going away,” said Frank Luntz, a Republican strategist who has been critical of Trump. Luntz said he believed the president had given every indication that he intends to remain active in Republican primaries.“He’s going to make the next four years a nightmare for the G.O.P.,” Luntz said.On Politics is also available as a newsletter.

	<title>We Need a Second Great Migration</title>
	<author>Charles M. Blow</author>
	<body>ATLANTA — A year ago this week, I packed some bags and left New York City for Atlanta.I’d lived in New York for 26 years. The city made me feel awake and alive — buildings tickling the sky, trains snaking underfoot. There was a seductive muscularity to the city, a feeling of riding the razor between your destiny and your demise.I had become a New Yorker, a Brooklyn boy. There I had raised my children. There I planned to live out my days.But the exquisite fierceness of the city, its blur of ambition and ingenuity, didn’t hide the fact that many of my fellow Black New Yorkers were locked in perpetual oppression — geographically, economically and politically isolated. All around the North, Black power, if it existed, was mostly municipal, or confined to regional representation. Black people were not serving as the dominant force in electing governors or senators or securing Electoral College votes.Bryan Stevenson, the executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, calls migrants of the Great Migration “refugees and exiles of terror.” By extension, many Black communities in Northern cities, abandoned by the Black elite and spurned by white progressives, have become, functionally, permanent refugee camps.I had an idea to change that. An idea about Black self-determination. Simply put, my proposition was this: that Black people reverse the Great Migration — the mass migration of millions of African-Americans largely from the rural South to cities primarily in the North and West that spanned from 1916 to 1970. That they return to the states where they had been at or near the majority after the Civil War, and to the states where Black people currently constitute large percentages of the population. In effect, Black people could colonize the states they would have controlled if they had not fled them.In the first census after the Civil War, three Southern states — South Carolina, Mississippi and Louisiana — were majority Black. In Florida, Blacks were less than two percentage points away from constituting a majority; in Alabama, it was less than three points; in Georgia, just under four.But the Great Migration hit the South like a bomb, siphoning off many of the youngest, brightest and most ambitious. In South Carolina, the Black share of the population declined from 55 percent to about 30 percent. Over six decades, six million people left the South.Reversing that tide would create dense Black communities, and that density would translate into statewide political power.Generally speaking, mass movements are largely for the young and unencumbered. Moving is expensive and psychologically taxing, displacing one from home, community and comforts. But I believe those obstacles are outweighed by opportunity. All who are able should consider this journey. That, it became clear, included me.I chose Atlanta because many of my friends were already there, having moved to the “hot” Southern city after college, and because I saw Georgia as on the cusp of transformational change. Little did I know that this election cycle would be a proof of concept for my proposal.In November, Georgia voted blue for the first time since Bill Clinton won the state in 1992. A majority of those who voted for Joe Biden were Black. This week, Georgia elected its first Black senator in state history — indeed the first popularly elected Democratic Black senator from the whole South: Raphael Warnock, a pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where Martin Luther King Jr. once preached. Georgia also elected its first Jewish senator — only the second from the South since the 1880s: Jon Ossoff.Perhaps most striking, the Warnock win was the first time in American history that a Black senator was popularly elected by a majority-Black coalition. It was a momentous flex of Black power.It was jarring to see that news almost immediately overshadowed by the vision of white rioters marauding through the Capitol on Wednesday. It was an affront, an attack. We must remember that while modern wails of white power may be expressed by a man in face paint and furs shouting from a purloined podium, Black power must materialize the way it did in Georgia.The success of the Democratic Party’s gains there were in part due to a massive voter enfranchisement effort led by Stacey Abrams, the former candidate for governor, whose group Fair Fight helped register 800,000 new voters in the state in just two years. But it was also attributable to a rise in the state’s Black population.In the early 1990s, Black people constituted a little over a quarter of the population; now they constitute about a third of it. The Atlanta metro area saw an increase of 251,000 Black people between 2010 and 2016. In 2018, The Atlantic magazine described this area as the “epicenter of what demographers are calling the ‘reverse Great Migration’” of Black people to the South.Biden carried the state by only around 12,000 votes. With this election, Georgia became the model for how Black people can experience true power in this country and alter the political landscape.I realize that I am proposing nothing short of the most audacious power play by Black America in the history of the country. This may seem an odd turn for me. I am not an activist. I am a newspaperman. I interpret. I bear witness.The moment that I realized that I could be more than an observer came in 2013. I was at the Ford Foundation for a series of lectures on civil rights when Harry Belafonte addressed the room. He spoke in a low-but-sure raspy voice, diminished by age, but deepened in solemnity. He was erudite and searing, and I was mesmerized. He posed a question: “Where are the radical thinkers?”That question kept replaying in my head, and it occurred to me that I had been thinking too small, all my life, about my approach to being in the world. I realized that a big idea could change the course of history.This proposition is my big idea.Many of the issues that have driven racial justice activists to organize and resist over the last few years — criminal justice, mass incarceration, voting rights and education and health policies — are controlled at the state level. The vast majority of people incarcerated in America, for example, are in state prisons: 1.3 million. Only about a sixth as many are in federal prisons. States have natural resources and indigenous industries. Someone has to control who is granted the right to exploit, and profit from, those resources. Why not Black people?Of course questions — and doubts — abound about such a proposal. Questions like: Isn’t the proposal racist on its face?No. The point here is not to impose a new racial hierarchy, but to remove an existing one. Race, as we have come to understand it, is a ﬁction; but, racism, as we have come to live it, is a fact. After centuries of waiting for white majorities to overturn white supremacy, it has fallen to Black people to do it themselves.I am unapologetically pro-Black, not because I believe in Black supremacy, which is as false and reckless a notion as white supremacy, but rather because I insist upon Black equity and equality. In a society and system in which white supremacy is ubiquitous and inveterate, Black people need ﬁerce advocates to help restore the balance — or more precisely, to establish that balance in the ﬁrst place.My call for Black power through Black majorities isn’t intended to exclude white people. Black majority doesn’t mean Black only. Even in the three states that once held Black majorities after the Civil War — South Carolina, Mississippi and Louisiana — those majorities were far from overwhelming, peaking at 61 percent, 59 percent and 52 percent.Nor does a majority-Black population mean a Blacks-only power structure. There are cities in the Northeast and Midwest, like Detroit, Philadelphia and Saint Louis, that have a Black majority or plurality and yet have white mayors. The point is not to create racial devotion, but rather race-conscious accountability.Others have objected: Isn’t the North just better for Black people than the South?Many Black people are leery of the South, if not afraid of it. They still have in their minds a retrograde South: dirty and dusty, overgrown and underdeveloped, a third-world region in a ﬁrst-world country. They see a region that is unenlightened and repressive, overrun by religious zealots and open racists. The caricatures have calciﬁed: hillbillies and banjos, Confederate ﬂags and the Ku Klux Klan.To be sure, all of that is here. But racism is more evenly distributed across the country than we are willing to admit.It is true that in surveys, people in the North express support for fewer racially biased ideas than those in the South, but such surveys reveal only which biases people confess to, not the ones they subconsciously possess. So I asked the researchers at Project Implicit to run an analysis of their massive data set to see if there were regional differences in pro-white or anti-Black prejudice. The result, which one of the researchers described as “slightly surprising,” was that there was almost no difference in the level of bias between white people in the South and those in the Northeast or Midwest. (The bias of white people in the West was slightly lower.)White people outside the South are more likely to say the right words, but many possess the same bigotry. Racism is everywhere. And if that’s the case, wouldn’t you rather have some real political power to address that racism? And a yard!For decades Northern liberals have maintained the illusion of their moral superiority to justify their lack of progress in terms of racial equality. The North’s arrogant insistence that it had no race problem, or at least a minimal one, allowed a racialized police militarism to take root. It allowed housing and education segregation to flourish in supposedly “diverse” cities. It allowed for the rise of Black ghettos and concentrated poverty as well as white ﬂight and urban disinvestment.The supposed egalitarianism of Northern cities is a ﬂimsy disguise for a white supremacy that diverges from its Southern counterpart only in style, not substance.And, while the North has been stuck in its self-righteous stasis, the savagery of the South has in some ways softened, or morphed. I am careful not to position this progress as fully redemptive or restorative. White supremacy clearly still exists here, corrupting everything from criminal justice to electoral access. The “New South” — with its thriving Black middle class and increasing political power — is still more aspiration than reality.But the wishful idealizing of a New South is no more naïve than a willful blindness to the transgressions of the Now North. As the author Jesmyn Ward wrote in 2018 in Time about her decision to leave Stanford and move back to Mississippi, American racism is an “inﬁnite room”: “It is the bedrock beneath the soil. Racial violence and subjugation happen on the streets of St. Louis, on the sidewalks of New York City and in the BART stations of Oakland.”Black people have traversed this country in search of a place where the hand of oppression was lightest and the spirit of prosperity was greatest, but have had to learn a bitter lesson: Racism is everywhere.Finally: Won’t this idea encounter powerful opposition, even from liberals?Well, when has revolution ever been easy? When has a ruling class humbly handed over power or an insurgent class comfortably acquired it? Revolution, even a peaceful one, is frightening, and dangerous, because those with power will view any attempt at divestiture as an act of war.The opposition will most likely manifest in many ways. There will no doubt be opposition from the Black Establishment in the North, and those in the political class whose ofﬁces will be in jeopardy if the Black populations in their cities shrink.This is a very real concern. There may be some ﬂuctuation in Black political representation during the course of a reverse migration, and, in the beginning, positions added in the South may not balance out those lost in the North. This is a function of how political machines operate, the way regions are gerrymandered, the way parties horse-trade, the way the establishment grooms ascendant stars, and the way voter suppression is inﬂicted. But, in the end, the beneﬁt and abundance of Black political power would be to the good.Even some white liberals, those who call themselves allies, may shrink from the notion of Black power, drawing a false equivalence to the concept of racial superiority espoused by the white power movement. They recoil from the very mention of Black power even as they live out their lives in a world designed by and for white power, not only the hooded and hailing, but also the robed and badged.Others may simply mourn the notion of a path to Black equality that doesn’t feature a starring role for white liberal guilt, one that doesn’t center on their capacity for growth and evolution, but skips over them altogether.Still others may simply hesitate because it sounds like I’m throwing in the towel on the grand experiment of multiculturalism. I sought for months to put this proposal to Bill Clinton, someone I thought had deftly navigated the racial mineﬁelds in the South. I got my chance in the wee hours of a summer night on Martha’s Vineyard in 2019. He responded with curiosity but not endorsement. The lack of approval was not deﬂating, because it had not been requested. Black people need no permission to seek their own liberation.The idea received a more enthusiastic reception from the Rev. William Barber, the father of the Moral Monday civil rights protests, who in 2018 reactivated the Poor People’s Campaign, the multiracial project Martin Luther King was organizing when he was assassinated. Barber, a staunch believer in what he calls “fusion coalition” and cross-racial alliance, pointed out that most of the people who marched with him in the Moral Monday protests were white. And yet he was open to the concept of reverse migration.“From state up is the only way,” he told me. “If you change the South, you change the entire nation.” This is not surprising coming from Barber, whose own parents were reverse migrants who moved back South to ﬁght racism.All these objections are to say nothing of the backlash to come from conservatives, of course. One lesson that history teaches is that the system reacts forcefully, often violently, when whiteness faces the threat of a diminution of its power. And that’s exactly what we saw in this week’s storming of the Capitol by supporters of the white power president Donald J. Trump, in concert with his efforts to overturn the election.For 150 years, Black Americans have been hoping and waiting. We have marched and resisted. Many of our most prominent leaders have appeased and kowtowed. We have seen our hard-earned gains eroded by an evolving white supremacy, while at the same time we have been told that true and full equality was imminent. But, there is no more guarantee of that today than there was a century ago.I say to Black people: Return to the South, cast down your anchor and create an environment in which racial oppression has no place.As Frederick Douglass once wrote about escaping slavery, “I prayed for 20 years but received no answer until I prayed with my legs.”Black people must once again pray with their legs.This is an adaptation from the forthcoming, “The Devil You Know: A Black Power Manifesto.”The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

	<title>Preserving New York’s Ties to the Underground Railroad</title>
	<author>John Freeman Gill</author>
	<body>Are landmarks that celebrate Black history given proper consideration by city government? That is a question hovering over two threatened antebellum houses once owned by abolitionists, one in Brooklyn and one in Manhattan, that have come before the Landmarks Preservation Commission in recent months.Sixteen years after a fierce preservation campaign was sparked by the city’s plan to use eminent domain to seize and demolish a Greek Revival rowhouse in Downtown Brooklyn that may have been a stop on the Underground Railroad, the proposed landmark at 227 Duffield Street finally received a public hearing at the commission in July. Support from elected officials and the public was overwhelming, with 131 people testifying or writing in favor of landmark status for the house, which was once owned by the avowed abolitionists Harriet and Thomas Truesdell. (The city’s first lady, Chirlane McCray, had previously urged the commission to make a thorough review of the property, a position echoed by Mayor Bill de Blasio.) The single voice in opposition at the hearing belonged to a lawyer for the house’s owner.But even as the public awaits an as-yet-unscheduled vote on landmark designation that could permanently protect 227 Duffield, new efforts to preserve a second endangered abolitionist-owned house, at 857 Riverside Drive, were swiftly rejected by the commission in late November.The proposed landmark would be unique in Upper Manhattan, which was miles north of the city in the mid-nineteenth century and which suffers from a notable underrepresentation among the borough’s historic districts. Of more than 37,000 city properties with landmark protection, just 17 sites are related to abolitionism or the Underground Railroad, the network of Black and white activists who helped enslaved African-Americans flee north to freedom before the Civil War. Only two such protected sites are in Manhattan, none above 29th Street.Although slavery was not fully abolished in New York State until 1827 and the city maintained strong ties to the Southern slave economy until the Civil War, a small number of courageous New Yorkers played a significant role in the effort to abolish slavery and help those fleeing bondage. But documenting a building’s connection to the Underground Railroad can be difficult, as those aiding fugitives often kept their activities clandestine out of necessity. The Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 subjected people harboring freedom seekers to heavy fines and six months in jail, even in free states.Additionally, Lower Manhattan, where much of the antebellum city was located and where many of those sympathetic to the Underground Railroad operated, has been largely redeveloped over the past 160 years, resulting in the loss of important Underground Railroad sites like the townhouse of the African-American publisher David Ruggles, at 36 Lispenard Street, which was demolished around 1875.The endangered two-story wood-frame house at Riverside and West 159th Street, built around 1851, is the only surviving Washington Heights home shot by the renowned photographer Berenice Abbott for her 1939 book, “Changing New York.” Abbott’s 1937 photograph shows a jaunty villa designed in a transitional Greek Revival-Italianate style, with Italianate scroll-sawn brackets at the eaves and windows as well as a wraparound porch adorned with lively scrollwork.The villa was also crowned with an octagonal, windowed cupola, an elegant topper that calls to mind the wood-frame dwelling at 200 Lafayette Avenue in Brooklyn. A designated landmark from the same period, that house also combines Greek Revival and Italianate elements, including a cupola built, as at 857 Riverside, to showcase what was once a fine waterfront view.But the Riverside house has been scalped of its cupola and shorn of its front porch, and the clapboard of its front facade has been replaced with faux-stone siding.The hits keep coming, too. In August, a demolition permit application was filed with the Buildings Department for 857 Riverside, following an application to construct a 13-story residential building on the site. At 135 feet, the proposed structure would tower over its three- and six-story neighbors.The owners on the demolition application are Michael Petrokansky and Sigmund Freund of Spencer Developers. And city records show that the property was purchased by a limited liability company, RSD857, in October 2019 from Albert Wright, a retired New York City Transit track worker, and his wife, Doreen Green. The real property transfer report, which showed a sale price of $975,000, was signed for the company by Mr. Petrokansky. But Mr. Wright, who encountered cascading financial trouble with banks beginning with the mortgage crisis of 2008, maintains that he was “swindled.” He has refused to leave, even as, he said, Mr. Petrokansky has brought in several tenants to share the house with him in conflict-ridden cohabitation.“We’re looking into the validity of the sales transaction, and we want to fight to deny his eviction,” said Lawrence Duran, Mr. Wright’s lawyer. “We believe he wasn’t entirely aware of everything that was going on when the transfer took place.”Mr. Wright said that if he gets the house back, he plans to replace its missing cupola, clapboard siding and wraparound porch.“I’m a contractor,” he said, “and I want the house to look like it did in 1851.”Mr. Petrokansky, reached briefly by telephone, declined to comment. Mr. Freund did not respond to repeated requests for comment.The campaign to obtain landmark protection for 857 Riverside, which has the backing of Community Board 12, the Manhattan borough president, Gale A. Brewer, and several other local officials, is a grass-roots effort launched by the Upper Riverside Residents Alliance.The house lies one block north of the Audubon Park Historic District, where heirs of the naturalist-painter John James Audubon carved a suburban community of Italianate villas out of the countryside in the 1850s.Matthew Spady, a historian who lives up the street from the threatened house and recently published a book about Audubon Park, provided a treasure trove of period research. Joseph V. Amodio, a freelance writer who also lives nearby, added his own research and penned a report on the history of the house, which the alliance submitted to the landmarks commission in November.The report contends that 857 Riverside is the last surviving link to the fiery abolitionist minister Dennis Harris, and that the house may even be tied to the Underground Railroad. Harris owned the house between 1852 and 1854, when he sold it to his business partner and fellow abolitionist Judge John Newhouse.Harris’s antislavery activism is strongly documented in the report, while the Harris-Newhouse Home’s possible use as a safe house for fugitives is conjecture.An English immigrant and sugar refiner, Harris was a complex figure who was an outspoken opponent of slavery while deriving his income from an industry largely dependent on what the abolitionist Frederick Douglass called “the bloody system.” At his Wesleyan Methodist chapel at 95 King Street in Lower Manhattan, Harris gave impassioned antislavery sermons and held abolitionist gatherings. Speakers included the relentless Underground Railroad leader Sydney Howard Gay and Lewis Tappan, a prominent abolitionist whose house at 86 Pierrepont Street is in the Brooklyn Heights Historic District.Harris’s sugar refinery, at 144 Duane Street in the area now called TriBeCa, was characterized as “a sort of Grand Central Station of the Underground Railroad” by an architect named William Johnson, a self-described “active operator” of the network.In what Mr. Amodio calls “a prototypical Black Lives Matter moment writ large,” a racist 1846 political cartoon shows a dehumanizing caricature of George Kirk, an African-American fugitive of Southern slavery, being violently captured by white pursuers who have discovered him inside a box on a horse-drawn wagon marked “D. Harris.” Harris had sent his dray to try to spirit Kirk to the safety of his refinery, but “the whole police force of the city turned slave-catcher,” according to the New-York Tribune, and Kirk was arrested by epithet-spewing policemen before being freed by a sympathetic judge.Harris’s refinery burned down in 1848, and the following year he paid $32,000 for the country estate of Ambrose Kingsland, a future mayor of New York, in what is now Washington Heights. Among the “several elegant building sites” that Harris then advertised for development was a three-acre lot that would become 857 Riverside. Harris sold the parcel to John King, a sometime employee, and by 1851, the cupola-crowned villa had risen. The next year, Harris bought back both house and land.According to Mr. Spady, the Audubon Park historian, the house may have been built by one of Audubon’s sons, who was putting up villas on his family’s land nearby and who also appears to have constructed a tenement for Harris.A man of ambition as well as humanity, Harris built a new refinery on the Hudson at 160th Street, down the hill from the little villa, along with a wharf. He also bought a steamboat, which ferried passengers from Lower Manhattan to Poughkeepsie, with a stop at the wharf on 158th Street. Establishing a passenger line to compete with the Hudson River Railroad was a dicey proposition. But Harris’s true motive was probably to create a new Underground Railroad stop, Mr. Spady surmised in his book, “The Neighborhood Manhattan Forgot.”The Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 permitted slave-hunters to capture alleged escaped slaves without due process, making the city far more dangerous for African-Americans. In the face of these new threats to fugitives, Mr. Spady wrote, the “refinery and steamboat could have extended Harris’s effort to move them farther up the river on their journey to freedom in Canada.”Beyond this possible infrastructure of liberty, Mr. Amodio’s report establishes that Harris and Newhouse were at the heart of a largely forgotten abolitionist enclave in northern Manhattan. In 1854, the pair co-founded the Washington Heights Congregational Church, which took an unwavering antislavery stance. Harris personally introduced as speakers two formerly enslaved African-American abolitionists, and a celebration of the sanctuary drew a delegate from Plymouth Church, an Underground Railroad hub now in the Brooklyn Heights Historic District.“Guys like Harris were certainly bucking the tide, they were certainly not in the mainstream at all of political and racial thinking in New York City,” Eric Foner, the author of “Gateway to Freedom: The Hidden History of the Underground Railroad,” said in an interview. “The city was tied in completely economically to the slave South. The New York merchants were the ones who transported southern cotton and controlled the cotton trade across to England.”New York companies also insured southern slave-owners against the death of their human chattel, while the city’s banks lent money for the purchase of slaves and southern plantation land. Brooks Brothers and other city garment companies made money clothing enslaved African-Americans. In addition, New York had a pro-southern municipal government.Kate Lemos McHale, director of research for the landmarks commission, was impressed with the report on the Harris-Newhouse Home, but not with the villa’s condition.“As a result of the extensive modifications that have been made to the house and its architectural details, it does not appear to retain the integrity necessary for consideration as an individual landmark,” she wrote in response. “The alterations include the removal of the octagonal cupola and wraparound porch along with their decorative trim, replacement of windows and doors and removal of their enframements, and the addition of the permastone veneer.”The house, she added, therefore “retains neither the historic appearance nor adequate historic fabric from the 19th-century abolitionist era.”Building modifications have also been an issue in the preservation struggle over the Truesdell house on Duffield Street (also known as Abolitionist Place), because a two-story storefront was added in the 1930s.Christabel Gough, the secretary of the Society for the Architecture of the City, said that intact historical fabric was not a legally required component of a landmark. The city landmarks law “states perfectly clearly that a landmark may have historic or aesthetic merits — it’s ‘or,’ not ‘and,’” she said. “The ugliest building in the world could be landmarked if it is historically important.”The insistence on the integrity of historic fabric also “raises an interesting issue of racial equity,” said Peter S. Green, a leader of the Upper Riverside Residents Alliance. “In a neighborhood like this, things happen like, ‘We can’t afford to maintain the cupola, so we have to take it off because the roof is leaking.’”The alliance and Ms. Brewer, the borough president, said they would continue the landmark fight and would challenge zoning determinations by the Buildings Department that might allow the house’s owners to put up a 13-story building.Michael Henry Adams, the author of “Harlem Lost and Found: An Architectural and Social History, 1765-1915,” said that the wood-frame house of the African-American inventor Lewis H. Latimer, in Flushing, Queens, offered a precedent for landmark designation of a historic home that had endured major modifications.“The Latimer House was not only altered to remove external ornament and everything, but it was even moved to a new site,” Mr. Adams said. “The designation helped to facilitate the restoration, and one could easily see the same thing happening here, so that if the building were designated and someone wanted to effect the restoration, then they could utilize the federal investment tax credit and the state investment tax credit, and that would be a benefit for the owner and the public.”The Latimer House was granted landmark status in 1995 and is now a museum that runs programs highlighting the contributions to technology of Latimer and other African-Americans.Mr. Adams will moderate a virtual discussion on 857 Riverside and other endangered houses in the Audubon Park area, hosted by Harlem One Stop and the Upper Riverside Residents Alliance, on January 10.As for the supposition that Harris used his boat and refinery and the 857 Riverside villa to help freedom seekers heading north, “everything sounds supportable based on what was going on in New York City at the time,” said Tom Calarco, a co-author of “Secret Lives of the Underground Railroad in New York City.” “The Wesleyan Methodist connection was huge because they were such radical abolitionists — they were helping hundreds of fugitive slaves a year.”Mr. Adams, the historian, said that quite apart from its antislavery connection, the Harris-Newhouse Home was worthy of landmark designation as a rare surviving example of a suburban wooden villa in Upper Manhattan, an ephemeral building type that proliferated there in the mid-19th century.But at a time when the country is grappling wrenchingly with the legacy of slavery and the treatment of its Black citizens, the link to Mr. Harris and abolitionism certainly adds resonance.If the house were preserved and restored, “it would become a place of pilgrimage for Black people, where teachers could take school kids and say, ‘Hey, look, right here in your own neighborhood, there were white people who were highly invested in the notion that people shouldn’t be slaves,’” said Mr. Adams, who is African-American. He added: “There are figures in our past, like this sugar refiner, who point the way of what we have to do to go forward to overcome the people who want to turn the clock back, and this house is a remarkable landmark that represents this man and his cause.”For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

	<title>Republicans splinter over whether to make a full break from Trump.</title>
	<author>Alexander Burns</author>
	<body>President Trump not only inspired a mob to storm the Capitol on Wednesday — he also brought the Republican Party close to a breaking point.Having lost the presidency, the House and now the Senate on Mr. Trump’s watch, Republicans are so deeply divided that many are insisting that they must fully break from the president to rebound.Those divisions were in especially sharp relief this week when scores of House Republicans sided with Mr. Trump in voting to block certification of the election — in a tally taken after the mob rampaged through the Capitol.Republicans who spent years putting off a reckoning with Mr. Trump over his dangerous behavior are now confronting a disturbing prospect: that Wednesday’s episode of violence, incited by Mr. Trump’s remarks, could linger for decades as a stain on the party — much as the Watergate break-in and the Great Depression shadowed earlier generations of Republicans.“His conduct over the last eight weeks has been injurious to the country and incredibly harmful to the party,” said Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey who was the first major Republican to endorse Mr. Trump.Mr. Christie said Republicans must “separate message from messenger,” because “I don’t think the messenger can recover from yesterday.”</body>

	<title>Labor force participation is stagnating, and some workers may never come back.</title>
	<author>Jeanna Smialek</author>
	<body>The share of Americans who are either working or looking for jobs remains well below pre-pandemic levels, data released Friday showed, a sign that many working-age adults have been pushed onto the labor market’s sidelines as the health crisis persists.Questions loom over whether and when the participation rate — the share of Americans who are employed or applying for work — will rebound. It held steady at 61.5 percent in December, down about 1.8 percentage points from February 2020. For people in their prime working years, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics defines as 25 to 54 years old, labor force participation is hovering around 81 percent, down 1.9 percent compared with February.The drop in participation has been slightly greater for women as service-sector jobs take heavy losses and as child-care duties disproportionately weigh on their ability to work. For prime-age women, participation had declined to 75 percent in December from 77.1 percent in February. For men, it was at 87.3 percent, down from a pre-pandemic 89.1 percent.It could be good news that the rate remained roughly stable in December relative to the prior month even as job losses resumed — suggesting that people weren’t growing discouraged and giving up on work altogether as the public health situation worsened.But policymakers are worried that some workers may never come back. That would leave households with less income and the economy as a whole with less potential productive capacity. A desire to avoid such long-term scarring has spurred both Congress’ major spending packages and the Federal Reserve’s low-interest rate policies.“Participation in the labor market remains notably below pre-pandemic levels,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed’s chair, said at his December news conference. “Although there has been much progress in the labor market since the spring, we will not lose sight of the millions of Americans who remain out of work.”</body>

	<title>Tax Help for People Who Miss Out on a Valuable Credit</title>
	<author>Ann Carrns</author>
	<body>Working families can benefit from a federal tax credit intended to put cash in their pockets. But millions of eligible people miss out on the rebate, known as the earned-income tax credit, because they don’t file tax returns.Now, a technology-oriented nonprofit organization, working with a longtime volunteer tax preparation program, aims to help more eligible people get the credit by simplifying free, remote tax preparation for them.Code for America, which works with government agencies and community organizations on technology issues, began working last year with groups participating in the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program, known as VITA, to help eligible people submit tax returns and claim the credit.VITA sites offer free tax preparation by volunteers trained and certified by the Internal Revenue Service. The I.R.S. helps to fund some sites with annual grants. VITA help is generally available to people earning $57,000 or less. The initiative began more than 50 years ago, and its preparers typically receive high marks for accuracy. About 1.6 million tax returns were filed through VITA sites in 2018, according to the I.R.S.About five million potentially eligible people fail to claim the earned-income tax credit annually, according to a report from the Tax Policy Center. Some people have incomes so low that they aren’t required to file a return but may not realize they must do so to claim the credit. Others do file returns but don’t claim the credit because of its complexity.“Tax forms are confusing,” said Amanda Renteria, chief executive officer of Code for America.The money is a boon for low-income families. The average credit for a family with children was about $3,200 in 2017, and research suggests families mostly use the money to cover basic needs, repair homes and cars, and get training to boost their job prospects.In 2020, as part of efforts to get more people to file for the credit, Code for America teamed up with dozens of VITA programs in 31 states to test a new digital tax preparation service called Get Your Refund. It expects to work with about 100 partners in the upcoming tax season, Ms. Renteria said.The trial was initially intended for a handful of locations, she said. But it expanded quickly in the pandemic. Most VITA sites had stopped offering in-person help, and many people who hadn’t recently filed tax returns had to register on a special I.R.S. website to get their $1,200 pandemic relief payments.The need for remote assistance was intense, Ms. Renteria said. In all, about 1,000 volunteers helped 30,000 people file tax returns via Get Your Refund, Code for America reported, with those filers getting an estimated $62 million in refunds, including tax credits and the stimulus payments.Courtney O’Reilly, director of Tax Help Colorado, a VITA participant that worked with Code for America in 2020, said that even without a pandemic, traditional VITA sites might not always be convenient for working families. People may be unable to take time off work to visit the location, and they may have to wait in line.“Free doesn’t always mean accessible,” Ms. O’Reilly said.Two years ago, the group started looking for ways to reach more families eligible for the earned-income tax credit, she said, and has found the Get Your Refund platform helpful.Using the Get Your Refund website or mobile app, filers can verify their identities and upload tax documents, then talk to a volunteer who will prepare their return, all without meeting with someone in person. The one-on-one help is crucial. Research by Code for America and others has found that telling people about the tax credit isn’t enough by itself to get them to claim it. People are often intimidated by the required tax information and may need help to complete the forms.Here are some questions and answers about the earned-income tax credit:How does the earned-income tax credit work?Credits are subtracted from the amount that you owe in taxes. The earned-income tax credit is “refundable,” which means that if a family’s credit is more than it owes in taxes, the excess is paid out as a refund.The amount of the credit varies based on your income, family size and filing status. For the tax year 2020, the credit is available for filers earning up to about $57,000. The maximum credit is $6,660.What if my income dropped in 2020 because of the pandemic?The latest round of federal pandemic relief addressed this situation. When you file your tax return for 2020, you will be able to use the income you earned in 2019 to qualify for the earned-income tax credit, as well as for the refundable portion of the child tax credit, if it results in larger credits. Generally, the amount of your credits increases as your earnings rise, up to the maximum allowable credits.When does tax filing season begin?The I.R.S. usually starts accepting tax returns in late January. People claiming the earned-income tax credit and the child tax credit typically file early. By law, as a fraud-prevention measure, the I.R.S. doesn’t pay out tax refunds for returns claiming the credits before mid-February.</body>

	<title>Guerrilla Leader, Drug Baron, Gold Magnate … and Now Social Reformer?</title>

	<body>MOENGOTAPOE, Suriname — A cavalcade of black sport utility vehicles pulled up at a small village in a jungle clearing in a remote corner of South America. A tall, heavyset man with thick gold chains hanging over a tight shirt emerged from the largest car to a chorus of cheers.The man, Ronnie Brunswijk, the child of subsistence farmers, had left the village of Moengotapoe in eastern Suriname in search of a better life 50 years ago. He was returning now as one of Suriname’s richest, most powerful and popular men, to bring electricity to his long-neglected community composed of the descendants of people who escaped slavery, known as Maroons.Mr. Brunswijk last year became the first Maroon to reach the post of vice president of this small South American nation, perched between the Atlantic Ocean and the Amazon rain forest. Along the way, he had been an elite paratrooper, a soccer player, a wanted bank robber, a guerrilla leader, a gold baron and a father to at least 50 children.His mother has said he has so many offspring that unknown people sometimes ask to hug her, claiming to be her grandchildren.Mr. Brunswijk has been convicted of drug trafficking in Europe but has helped to bring democracy to his homeland. His generosity has earned him the nickname of Robin Hood and the worship of supporters, but has left many Surinamese questioning the source of his wealth and his political motives.In many ways, Mr. Brunswijk epitomizes the contradictions of Suriname’s small, insular society, where lines between heroes and villains are in flux, where history instantly becomes myth and the people have learned that to keep social peace it pays not to ask too many questions.“Everything I have, I give it to the people,” Mr. Brunswijk, 59, said in an interview in his office in a former colonial office overlooking Suriname’s staid capital of Paramaribo last month. “Ever since I was a child, I wanted to help others. I now have the chance to help the whole country.”Dressed in a sumptuous suit and tie, Mr. Brunswijk projects the aura of an imposing statesman, guiding his impoverished nation to oil riches from newly discovered offshore deposits and improving the lives of Suriname’s marginalized Maroon minority.It is a stark makeover for a man who used to shower supporters with money from a helicopter and whose mug shot was displayed in wanted posters across the country during the years of Suriname’s military dictatorship, which officially ended in 1988.His unlikely life story is in many ways the story of Suriname’s turbulent journey through economic crisis and political violence since it emerged from Dutch colonial rule in 1975.“Mr. Brunswijk has his history. We could look at his history and see that as a barrier,” said Suriname’s president, Chan Santokhi, a former police officer who tracked Mr. Brunswijk as a fugitive in the 1980s before asking him to form a coalition government last year. “We’re looking forward to a better future, because we are two leaders who have been entrusted to lead this nation together,” he said in an interview.Mr. Brunswijk was born into a family of 10 surviving children, in one of Suriname’s poorest regions. The family lived mostly on the rice, cassava and bananas they managed to coax from the thin, sandy soil. The occasional meat came from the wild animals Mr. Brunswijk and his brothers stalked with cutlasses.“Life was not great,” Agnes Brunswijk, the vice president’s mother, said in an interview outside her home near Moengotapoe. “We had to struggle.”She said the family’s large size and meager resources taught Mr. Brunswijk at an early age to share with others, a quality that would become his hallmark. He was a “mischievous” boy, she said, who fought with neighboring children but also cut firewood for older people.Mr. Brunswijk’s life changed when a Roman Catholic priest picked him, the only one among his siblings, to attend a boarding school in a nearby town at age 10.“I didn’t see electricity until I went to the boarding school,” recalled Mr. Brunswijk.Further studies eventually brought Mr. Brunswijk to Paramaribo, where in 1980 he said he was drafted into Suriname’s budding national army by Desiré Bouterse, the military dictator who had recently seized power with a promise to sweep away the corruption of post-colonial rulers.Singled out for his strength, Mr. Brunswijk became one of Suriname’s first 12 paratroopers and was sent for military training to Cuba, before being handpicked by Mr. Bouterse as his bodyguard.The two men grew close, but Mr. Brunswijk said their relationship soured as the dictator began murdering political opponents and cracking down on the independent-minded Maroon communities.“Maroon people don’t like being pressured,” Mr. Brunswijk said. “One day I said, ‘This is wrong.’ I had enough.”The ensuing split has defined Suriname’s history ever since.Mr. Brunswijk left the military in 1984, went on the run and began building his enduring Robin Hood myth, earning a conviction for bank robbery and armed theft and a reputation among Maroon villagers for generous handouts.Mr. Brunswijk has denied committing the crimes, saying the convictions were part of Mr. Bouterse’s effort to discredit a rival. Without offering details, he said his gifts came from the money he made at a gold mine.He was eventually captured, but managed to escape and fled to the Netherlands, where he joined Surinamese political exiles plotting Mr. Bouterse’s overthrow.He returned to Suriname in 1986 and triggered an armed uprising, commanding a force that grew to 1,200 men in a civil war that lasted six years. What he lacked in military experience and strategic vision he compensated for with sheer force of will, war veterans have said.“He had a strong spirit in him,” Petrus Adam, a former rebel commander, said in an interview. “He didn’t need to pay people. They came to him, they obeyed him.”The motley force managed to fight the government to a standstill and helped initiate Suriname’s return to democracy. But the political compromise came at the cost of hundreds of deaths and the destruction of Suriname’s economy, from which the young nation never fully recovered.The war was also the start of accusations that Mr. Brunswijk was involved in the drug trade, as both sides turned to cocaine to finance the conflict, Dutch historians have said.In 1999, a Dutch court convicted Mr. Brunswijk in absentia of running a cocaine smuggling ring. A similar conviction followed in France a year later, but he has steadfastly denied any involvement in drug trafficking.He said his fortune came instead from timber and gold-mining concessions he obtained after the war. His first venture was a sawmill, which he set up with a business grant from the Dutch government.He used the money to go into politics, capturing the small but crucial Maroon vote share and becoming the kingmaker in Suriname’s parliamentary electoral system. He was re-elected to Parliament last year and formed a coalition government with Mr. Santokhi, the president.As a politician, Mr. Brunswijk continued to help Surinamese in need, paying for medical bills, funerals and houses and earning the devotion of Maroon communities.The aid ranges from the extravagant to poignant. He has bought new cars for the entire squad of a local soccer team that he owns. But he also helped many refugees return to their villages after the war.His detractors say the handouts merely keep Mr. Brunswijk’s constituents dependent without offering a real path to self-improvement. But his supporters say the charity is a lifeline in a country without real social protections, and petitioners from across Suriname flock to his office every day.Mr. Brunswijk now hopes to use his high office to build a real social safety net in Suriname and to bring basic infrastructure to the remote communities that have been ignored by the country’s rulers for centuries.“This is a historic moment, when the village of my birth can finally have constant electricity,” a visibly moved Mr. Brunswijk said after turning on a power plant in Moengotapoe in December to the joyful chanting of residents. “I always wanted to make this a reality, and now that I’m the vice president, I finally can.”Ank Kuipers contributed reporting from Paramaribo, Suriname.</body>

	<title>Para un 2021 más sano, conserva los mejores hábitos de un año muy malo</title>
	<author>Tara Parker-Pope</author>
	<body>Aquí hay una mejor manera de empezar el 2021: saltarse los tradicionales propósitos de enero y apartar tiempo para reflexionar sobre el nuevo año.Tómate un momento para recordar los últimos 365 días de tu vida. Dentro de unos años, cuando hables del 2020, ¿qué historias contarás? ¿Serán los aplausos para los trabajadores sanitarios todas las noches a las 7? O tal vez será un recuerdo de los meses que pasaste casi siempre en casa con miembros de tu familia, o las “burbujas” pandémicas que formaste y que ayudaron a que las amistades se fortalecieran. Tal vez contarás la historia de la pérdida de un ser querido o recordarás que encontraste fuerza y resistencia que no sabías que tenías.Aunque revivir gran parte de 2020 puede parecer una idea terrible, los psicólogos dicen que es una mejor manera de comenzar el Año Nuevo. Mirar hacia atrás te ayudará a basarte en las lecciones que aprendiste, e incluso puede que descubras algunas costumbres positivas ocultas que no sabías que habías desarrollado.“No creo que nos hayamos dado suficiente crédito”, dijo Kelly McGonigal, psicóloga de la salud y profesora de la Universidad de Stanford y autora de The Willpower Instinct. “No creo que hayamos tenido el aprecio emocional que necesitamos y merecemos por el tipo de año que mucha gente ha tenido”, dijo McGonigal. “La reflexión que se necesita es una mirada real, honesta y autocompasiva sobre lo que se ha perdido, quién se ha perdido y qué es lo que se quiere elegir para recordar el año 2020. La reflexión es una manera de estar listo para avanzar hacia el nuevo año. Digo eso todos los años, pero creo que es especialmente cierto para este 2021”.Reflexionar sobre lo que lograste en 2020 —y lo que no viviste o perdiste— también es un camino más saludable para mejorar que el típico propósito de año nuevo. Los estudios muestran de manera consistente que esos propósitos no funcionan. Para febrero, la mayoría de la gente los ha abandonado.El problema con muchos propósitos es que tienden a ser inherentemente autocríticos y provienen de una especie de pensamiento mágico que gira en torno a la idea de que con un gran cambio —algo de pérdida de peso, ejercicio regular, más dinero— la vida se transformará. “Es demasiado fácil buscar un comportamiento por el que te criticas regularmente o por el que te sientes culpable”, dijo McGonigal. “Es esa falsa promesa del tipo: ‘Si cambias esto, cambiarás todo’”.Los estudios muestran que una de las mejores maneras de cambiar el comportamiento y formar un nuevo hábito es unirlo con un comportamiento existente, lo que en la ciencia de la formación de hábitos se llama “acumulación”. Es la razón por la que los médicos, por ejemplo, sugieren tomar un nuevo medicamento al mismo tiempo que nos cepillamos los dientes o tomamos café por la mañana: es más probable que recuerdes tomar tu píldora cuando la unes a un hábito existente. Añadir pasos a tu recorrido diario es a menudo una mejor manera de añadir ejercicio a tu día que tratar de establecer un tiempo separado para una caminata diaria.Reflexionando sobre las lecciones del año pasado, podemos apilar y construir con base en los buenos hábitos que empezamos en 2020. Tal vez eso implicó descubrir nuevas formas de hacer ejercicio cuando los gimnasios estaban cerrados, fortalecer las amistades forjadas a través de nuestras burbujas sociales, organizar nuestros hogares para vivir y aprender las 24 horas del día, aprender a cocinar comidas más saludables o hacernos responsables del cuidado de los demás.Ahora, con la distribución de vacunas y el fin de la pandemia a la vista, no es necesario abandonar esos cambios, sino tratar de edificar sobre sus bases.El primer desafío es el siguiente. Cada día de esta semana, el Reto de 7 días de la sección Well identificará un hábito popular de cuarentena y ofrecerá una nueva estrategia para convertirlo en un hábito saludable para toda la vida. Día unoEl aplauso de cuarentena se convirtió en un ritual nocturno en muchas partes de Estados Unidos, y en todo el mundo, en una especie de agradecimiento colectivo a los trabajadores de la salud. Era al mismo tiempo una muestra de comunidad y una expresión de gratitud. La experiencia fue lo que los sociólogos llaman “efervescencia colectiva”, que ocurre cuando la gente se reúne simultáneamente y participa en un ritual grupal.Aplaudir a los trabajadores esenciales tuvo el efecto de “unificar y dinamizar al grupo para la acción hacia una causa común, como la perseverancia a través de la pandemia”, dijo Joshua W. Brown, profesor del Departamento de Ciencias Psicológicas y del Cerebro de la Universidad de Indiana en Bloomington. “Las expresiones grupales de gratitud pueden ser muy poderosas tanto para quienes las expresan como para quienes las reciben”.Tal vez mostraste gratitud de otras maneras. ¿Ofreciste mayores propinas de las habituales a los trabajadores de los restaurantes y repartidores? ¿Te encontraste diciendo un sincero agradecimiento a los trabajadores del supermercado y la farmacia en la caja? Cuando las cosas se pusieron difíciles en casa, ¿te recordaste a ti mismo y a tus hijos todas las cosas por las que te sentiste agradecido? En mi caso, adopté un ritual de gratitud particular: al momento de lavarme las manos pienso en diez cosas por las que estoy agradecido, una por cada dedo que lavo.Por qué importa: Numerosos estudios muestran que las personas que tienen una práctica diaria de gratitud, en la que cuentan conscientemente sus bendiciones, tienden a ser más felices, tienen menores niveles de estrés, duermen mejor y son menos propensos a experimentar depresión. En un estudio, los investigadores reclutaron a 300 adultos, la mayoría de ellos estudiantes universitarios que buscaban asesoramiento en salud mental. Todos los voluntarios recibieron asesoramiento, pero un grupo añadió un ejercicio de escritura centrado en las malas experiencias, mientras que otro grupo escribió una carta de agradecimiento a otra persona cada semana durante tres semanas. Un mes más tarde, los que escribieron cartas de agradecimiento reportaron una salud mental significativamente mejor. Y el efecto parece durar. Tres meses después, los expertos escanearon los cerebros de los estudiantes mientras realizaban un ejercicio de gratitud diferente. Los alumnos que habían escrito cartas de gratitud anteriormente en el estudio mostraron una mayor activación en una parte del cerebro llamada corteza prefrontal media, que se cree que está relacionada tanto con la recompensa como con la cognición de alto nivel.Esta semana, prueba uno o más de estos simples ejercicios de gratitud.Empieza por algo pequeño. Envía un correo electrónico o un texto de agradecimiento, agradece a un trabajador de servicio o diles a tus hijos, tu cónyuge o un amigo cómo han mejorado tu vida. “Una gran manera de desarrollar más gratitud sería dar pequeños pasos regulares: un correo electrónico o una nota de agradecimiento extra a un colega, o un agradecimiento extra en persona, y centrarse en lo gratificante que es alegrarle el día a alguien con agradecimiento”, dijo Brown.Crear un recordatorio de gratitud. McGonigal guarda una nota adhesiva en su lámpara de escritorio que dice:1. Alguien2. Algo3. Tú mismoEs un recordatorio diario para expresar gratitud no solo por las personas, eventos y regalos en tu vida, sino también por tus propios logros. Es posible que sientas gratitud por completar un entrenamiento, por un cuerpo sano o por asumir un nuevo reto. “La gratitud es realmente buena cuando lo que se necesita es creer en la capacidad de crear un futuro más positivo y estar dispuesto a confiar en otros para que te ayuden a hacerlo”, dijo McGonigal. “Y me parece que esa es una muy buena mentalidad por ahora”.Expresa tu gratitud por escrito. Puedes enviar correos electrónicos o publicar sentimientos de gratitud en las redes sociales o en un chat grupal. O piensa en alguien en tu vida y escríbele una carta de agradecimiento. (No tienes que enviarla por correo). Llena tu carta con detalles que describan cómo esa persona influyó en tu vida y las cosas que aprecias de él o ella. O lleva un diario de gratitud.“Creo que el potencial de la gratitud se desarrolla plenamente cuando la gente es capaz de expresar su gratitud con palabras”, dijo Y. Joel Wong, presidente del Departamento de Asesoramiento y Psicología Educativa de la Universidad de Indiana. “Cuando podemos decir lo que agradecemos y explicar por qué, eso cambia nuestra atención de lo negativo hacia lo positivo en nuestras vidas”.Tara Parker-Pope es la editora fundadora de Well, el galardonado sitio de salud para el consumidor de The New York Times.

	<title>The White House slips deeper into crisis in the final days of the Trump presidency.</title>
	<author>Maggie Haberman</author>
	<body>What was already shaping up as a volatile final stretch to the Trump presidency took on an air of national emergency as the White House emptied out and some Republicans joined Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a cascade of Democrats calling for Mr. Trump to be removed from office without waiting the 13 days until the inauguration of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.The prospect of actually short-circuiting Mr. Trump’s tenure in its last days appeared remote. Vice President Mike Pence privately ruled out invoking the disability clause of the 25th Amendment to sideline the president, as many had urged that he and the cabinet do, according to officials.Democrats suggested they could move quickly to impeachment, a step that would have its own logistical and political challenges. Representative Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, the assistant speaker of the House, said Friday on CNN that the Democrats could get an impeachment vote to the House floor as early as the middle of next week.(The Democrat-led House already impeached Mr. Trump once in December 2019, and he was acquitted in the Senate. The process took months.)But the highly charged debate about Mr. Trump’s capacity to govern even for less than two weeks underscored the depth of anger and anxiety after the invasion of the Capitol that forced lawmakers to evacuate, halted the counting of the Electoral College votes for several hours and left people dead, including a Capitol Hill police officer who died Thursday night.After Mr. Trump’s Twitter account was restored, he posted a 2½-minute video on Thursday evening denouncing the mob attack in a way that he had refused to do a day earlier. Reading dutifully from a script prepared by his staff, he declared himself “outraged by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem” and told those who broke the law that “you will pay.”While he did not give up his false claims of election fraud, he finally conceded defeat. “A new administration will be inaugurated on Jan. 20,” Mr. Trump acknowledged. “My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power. This moment calls for healing and reconciliation.”Michael R. Sherwin, the U.S. attorney in Washington, did not rule out investigating Mr. Trump himself when he pledged to investigate “all actors” in Wednesday’s siege. The president is said to have discussed pardoning himself.Despite the talk of healing, however, Mr. Trump quietly made plans to take a trip next week to the southwestern border to highlight his hard-line immigration policies, which have inflamed Washington over the years, according to a person briefed on the planning. He also told advisers he wanted to give a media exit interview, which they presumed might undercut any conciliatory notes. But the first family has discussed leaving the White House for good on Jan. 19, the day before the inauguration.</body>

	<title>For Immigrants Watching a Mob Storm the Capitol, a Sense of Shock and Shame</title>
	<author>Miriam Jordan</author>
	<body>A little more than five years ago, Ahmad Shah Srosh was standing alongside the U.S. soldiers who had come to his country, helping them promote democracy to his fellow Afghans. He was called an “infidel” for this work; his brother was murdered because of it. But Mr. Shrosh saw in the United States an example of the rewards that awaited when true democracy took root.“Every country follows the democracy of the United States,” Mr. Srosh, 31, said from his home in Houston, where he now lives with his wife, Hassina, and two U.S.-born daughters.On Wednesday, he watched the footage of American mobs storming into the Capitol, leading a frenzied parade through the rotunda and ransacking congressional offices. It reminded him of insurgents in his home country, pillaging cultural sites and desecrating sanctuaries in the name of regime change. It was all so saddening.“Yesterday was the blackest day for democracy, not just in the United States but the world,” he said. “Those people brought us shame. They tried to show democracy is nothing.”The overrunning of the Capitol was a shocking sight for Americans, who never thought they would see something like it in their home country. But it triggered a particularly complicated wave of emotions among immigrants and refugees, especially those who fled from countries wracked by violence and instability.Some found it painfully reminiscent of what they thought they had left behind, and others wondered what other terrible things could lie ahead. And many, like Mr. Srosh, spoke of shame. After years of seeing the United States as a beacon of democracy, these new Americans found themselves asking: Had their new country fallen this low? Or was this what it was all along?Many countries around the world, including some of the very nations that thousands of refugees in America once fled, condemned, gloated or expressed alarm about the events in Washington.The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it believed the country would overcome “this internal political crisis in a mature manner,” but warned Turkish citizens in the United States to avoid crowded areas nonetheless.The Venezuelan government condemned the “spiral of violence” but expressed hope that it would end soon and “the people of the U.S. can finally open a new path toward stability and social justice.” Russian officials, Iranian leaders and even Moktada al-Sadr, once the leader of an insurgent militia that was a bitter enemy of the American armed forces in Iraq, all pointed to the scenes at the Capitol as proof of U.S. hypocrisy.Many immigrants were all too aware of what the world was seeing of their adopted home. Through Facebook, text apps and phone calls, messages have been coming in from friends and family asking what was going on, how it came to this, and whether they were safe living in America.Benedict Killang’s father calls him regularly from South Sudan, a place Mr. Killang left 25 years ago when every day seemed more dangerous and violent than the one before. In recent days and weeks, he has been calling with a growing sense of worry.“He is just calling to check in,” said Mr. Killang, 50, now raising four children in Pittsburgh. “He is saying, ‘The place you are in is not safe.’” Particularly after Wednesday’s events, Mr. Killang cannot fully disagree.The images of the rioting in Washington are disorientingly far from the idea of the country many immigrants thought they were coming to, a place most of them believed to be of singular stability and openness.Living for years in a camp for Bhutanese refugees in Nepal, Khara Timsina dreamed of America as a place where he would finally be able to speak freely without fear of retribution. It was clearly the greatest, most democratic place on earth, he thought then.Reality did not quite meet expectations when he arrived in Pittsburgh 12 years ago. The country was not as welcoming to outsiders as he had pictured. In recent years, as President Trump and others spoke with increasing hostility toward immigrants, he had begun to fear that worse days were coming.“But not as worse as what I witnessed yesterday,” he said. He had found a home in the United States, after being stateless for most of his life, but now, he said, “it’s a shame to be an American.”Plenty of immigrants and refugees are used to feeling such sentiments about the countries they had fled; that was why many had left them. It was feeling this way about America that was new.Debating a criminal referral. The Jan. 6 House committee has grown divided over whether to make a criminal referral of former President Donald J. Trump to the Justice Department, even though it has concluded that it has enough evidence to do so. The debate centers on whether a referral would backfire by politically tainting the expanding federal investigation.Cooperating with investigators. Pat A. Cipollone and Patrick F. Philbi, two of Mr. Trump’s top White House lawyers, met with the Jan. 6 House committee, while Ali Alexander, a prominent organizer of pro-Trump events after the 2020 election, said he would assist in the federal investigation.Contempt charges. The House voted to recommend criminal contempt of Congress charges against Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino Jr., two close allies of Mr. Trump, after the pair defied subpoenas from the special committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack.“We witnessed a rupture of democracy that we thought we could only experience in banana republics like my own,” said Jessika Giron, 46, of Honduras. Ms. Giron, who lives in Dover, N.J., with two American children, said that her family and friends in Honduras bombarded her with texts after seeing the images of U.S. lawmakers barricaded against a rampaging mob.What transpired on Wednesday reminded her of the dark days in Honduras, most recently the coup d’etat in 2009. She knew firsthand what it looks like when democracy is cracking, and now she was witnessing it in the nation that embodies it. “At what point have we arrived, when the Congress is invaded by a disorderly group of people? This situation is not good at all,” she said. “These are signs that you cannot ignore.”The familiarity of it all was perhaps the most disconcerting part.Carla Miranda, 34, a lawyer, fled Venezuela in 2013 after receiving death threats for representing people in opposition to the former strongman Hugo Chávez. “All these things that happened yesterday brought back bad memories,” she said of the rioters who invaded the Capitol. “It reminded me of the Chavistas. They look a lot like the Chavistas. They followed all these conspiracy theories.”Ms. Miranda said she had never intended to leave her homeland but was forced to flee after receiving death threats. During the past four years in the United States, she has grown increasingly uncomfortable with the leadership of the president, seeing in many of the hard-right Trump loyalists frightening echoes of the paramilitary groups — the “colectivos” — through which Mr. Chavez imposed his will. The mob attack on Wednesday shook her to her core.“It’s terrifying because I see how challenging the next few years will be for us,” she said. “We believe in this country, freedom of speech and the values this country upholds. Abroad we call this country the land of freedom. Immigrants like me come here looking for that.”Doubts about that had begun seeping in. Even some immigrants who had supported Mr. Trump, drawn to a sort of tough talk they thought reflected the brutal realities of the world, had already been growing uneasy with how aggressively that tough talk was being used at home. The question for many of them now is how much worse it might become, even after Mr. Trump leaves office. No one — neither their fellow immigrants nor their American-born friends — seems to have a good answer.Late into Wednesday night, Felix Lohitai was texting with friends around the country, both immigrants and homegrown Americans, about the rioting in the nation’s capital.“The immigrants saw what happened with a feeling of despair,” Mr. Lohitai said. “‘Oh we thought this was only happening in our country, and it is happening here.’ Most of the Americans are feeling shame, asking how did we let this happen.”Mr. Lohitai was in neither camp. As a young man he fought as a soldier in South Sudan; when he arrived in the United States as a refugee in his 30s he studied international relations in college. Now he is 56, an American citizen living in Erie, Pa., with three children in the U.S. armed forces. Very little surprises him anymore.“I was not shocked, I was not,” he said of the day’s events. He ticked off a long list of strongmen rulers around the world, some he knew about from firsthand experience, some he had studied. They all rose to power in political environments similar to what the United States has experienced in the last few years, he said, and they all had certain qualities he now sees in Mr. Trump.“He showed Americans the truth,” Mr. Lohitai said. “This is a divided country.”</body>

	<title>What We Found in Robert Caro’s Yellowed Files</title>
	<author>Dan Barry</author>
	<body>A seasoned curator entered the spare Upper West Side office of her subject the way a student of art might approach the Louvre. Eyes wide, notebook in hand.Along the wall was pinned the 27-page outline for a section of a long, long-anticipated book: the fifth and last volume of a magisterial biography of President Lyndon Baines Johnson.In a corner sat the idiosyncratic desk designed decades ago for her subject by the personal physician of another back-pain sufferer, John F. Kennedy. And on that desk, a Smith Corona Electra 210, a model of typewriter last manufactured in the 1970s.Plugged in.“Wow,” said the curator, Debra Schmidt Bach, which is pretty much all one can say upon entering the writing sanctuary of the author Robert A. Caro.Anyone not familiar with the name can find a measure of his elevated status in the carefully appointed backdrops seen these days on cable-news programs. Often prominent on the bookshelves of pundits is “The Power Broker,” the classic, Bible-thick exploration of government, politics and influence.By Robert A. Caro.At 85, Mr. Caro is bespectacled, graying and old-school; he routinely wears a jacket and tie to an office where he is the only occupant. He is also a superstar chronicler of 20th-century America whose patient methodology — grounded in the belief that time equals truth — has long since entered literary lore.He has spent most of the last year re-researching and rewriting a single section of the new volume, about how Johnson succeeded in getting monumental initiatives enacted into law — including voting rights and Medicare — while simultaneously escalating American involvement in the tragic Vietnam War.Wow.Early last year the New-York Historical Society arranged to acquire Mr. Caro’s substantial archives, including the files for his Johnson masterwork and for “The Power Broker,” which examined how one unelected official, Robert Moses, used his political wiles to reshape the New York metropolitan region.But as Ms. Bach, a curator for the society, would learn, the Caro records extend much deeper into the past — back to when he was a young newspaper reporter — revealing hints of the compassionate rigor that would one day earn the writer international acclaim.Peering into a file cabinet crammed with Johnsonian nuggets, Mr. Caro looked up and, not for the only time, asked, “Do you want to see?”There was only one answer.Ms. Bach, 58, has curated exhibitions on subjects as varied as the history of New York breweries, the comic book superheroes of Gotham and the treasures of Congregation Shearith Israel. Her mission now was to begin imagining a permanent Caro exhibition, planned for September in the historical society’s building at 77th Street and Central Park West.“I need to figure out a way to have these paper-based materials displayed so that they can really speak for themselves,” Ms. Bach said. (If these papers could speak, they would be in the author’s distinctly New York accent.)Her quest began in Mr. Caro’s office. There are no knickknacks, no works of art; the only appliances are a coffee maker and an electric pencil sharpener.“I try to have nothing in the room that’s not about writing,” he said. “It’s hard enough to concentrate.”“Right,” Ms. Bach said, taking notes.His desk is actually two combined, both modest. One he found left behind in an office he used to rent on West 57th Street. The other features a half-circle cutout that, like many things in Mr. Caro’s world, has a story behind it.Nearly 50 years ago, when he was just beginning his research for “The Power Broker,” Mr. Caro badly injured his back while playing basketball. “We were totally broke, and I couldn’t sit up to write,” he said.Taking a long shot, his wife, Ina, contacted Dr. Janet Travell, an expert in musculoskeletal pain who was President Kennedy’s personal physician. She is responsible for Kennedy’s use of a rocking chair, which became a symbol of his presidency.Taking on the case, Dr. Travell — who also served as physician to Mr. Caro’s future subject, President Johnson — studied how Mr. Caro sat at his desk. She then devised a godsend of a solution: a semicircle cutout in the desktop that alleviates pressure on his back as he types.“These days, if I hurt my back, the best place to be is not my bed,” Mr. Caro said. “It’s my desk.”Just as iconic, at least among the Caro-obsessed, is the Smith Corona Electra 210. The anachronism is an extension of the man, reflecting his desire to pin down elusive historical moments with strikes of keys against paper you can hold.Mr. Caro has amassed 14 of these machines, which he cycles through a typewriter shop in Chelsea for maintenance and repair. He also found a man in Cleveland who agreed to make cotton typewriter ribbons — if he ordered in bulk. (He did.)Under gentle questioning by Ms. Bach, Mr. Caro said that his favorite is on the desk, while a close second is at his home near Sag Harbor, on Long Island.“Don’t make me sound like too much of a schmuck,” Mr. Caro added, just as gently.How did his archives wind up with the New-York Historical Society? Another story.Mr. Caro grew up on Central Park West, between 93rd Street and 94th Street. His mother, Cele, learned she had cancer when he was 5 and died when he was 11. On many Saturdays, her sister, his Aunt Bea, would take the boy to lose himself in either the American Museum of Natural History or the New-York Historical Society.Fast-forward to 2018. Mr. Caro realized that he would have to deal someday with his extensive archives; a few libraries had already inquired. “But my head was always in my book,” he said.In his heart, though, Mr. Caro knew where he wanted his papers to go: the same historical society building where he found distraction as a boy, a beloved aunt by his side. He asked a friend to inquire whether there was interest. There most emphatically was.Louise Mirrer, the president of the historical society, made a generous offer and said a few magical words that clinched the deal. At a dinner with the Caros a few nights later, she elaborated: The papers would be processed quickly, made part of a permanent, rotating Caro exhibit and be easily available to future scholars in a dedicated study area — a stipulation dear to a man who had been told too often in his research that so-and-so’s papers were unavailable.“Everything I wanted, consciously or subconsciously, was suddenly being voiced by the woman across the table,” Mr. Caro said.Now he was showing Ms. Bach a small sample of the thousands of interview transcripts, manuscripts and notebooks that the society had acquired. Here was a stenographer’s pad, on the cover of which was scrawled “LBJ I,” and which contained notes from interviews with Johnson’s wife, Lady Bird, and brother, Sam. There, a cabinet drawer filled with files: “Campaign aftermath”; “Vietnam”; “Bundy-Moyers.”The notebooks reflected just one part of Mr. Caro’s laborious, step-by-step process: reading, researching, interviewing, organizing, assembling a comprehensive outline and, finally, pecking at a typewriter, with papers sullied by rejected language crumpled and thrown in the general direction of a wastebasket.“There’s a belief among some — not all — nonfiction writers that all that matters is to get the facts,” Mr. Caro said, reflecting on his continuing quest to find the right words. “I don’t believe that. I believe that the quality of writing is just as important in nonfiction as in fiction.”He said he often keeps a note on his desk lamp that reads, “The only thing that matters is what is on this page.”But so much of Mr. Caro’s research never made the page. For example, he interviewed all the key aides to Fiorello La Guardia, who served as New York’s mayor from 1934 to 1945. Yet only a minuscule fraction of that research appeared in “The Power Broker.”This is one reason he wanted the archives to be accessible to the public. The unpublished materials extend well beyond Moses and Johnson to encompass much of American life over the last century, from the streets of New York City to the rutted roads of the Texas Hill Country — to the marbled halls of the United States Senate.“Years of observation,” he said, by which he meant more than a half-century.Ms. Mirrer said in an email that the acquisition would secure the historical society’s place “as among the greatest destinations for research in — and understanding of — 20th-century history.” The Caro archives, she said, also demonstrate “the transformative effect that the skills of an investigative journalist can have on historical research.”“I could not be more thrilled,” Ms. Mirrer said.With much more to share, Mr. Caro led Ms. Bach and James Hicks, an exhibition designer, out into the cold, wet morning and a few dozen paces east to his apartment. Stored there were more than two dozen scrapbooks — many of them never before seen by anyone outside his family — that had been assembled by his wife, his indispensable research partner.Mr. Caro has no shortage of clippings, having won nearly every literary honor, among them the Pulitzer Prize for biography twice; the National Book Critics Circle Award three times; the Gold Medal in Biography from the American Academy of Arts and Letters; the National Humanities Medal, given to him in 2010 by a big fan, President Barack Obama. He is even a “living landmark,” according to the New York Landmarks Conservancy.But the half-dozen scrapbooks he had chosen to share with Ms. Bach — already stacked on the dining room table — mostly included items from the time before Robert Caro was ROBERT CARO. To when he was a fledgling reporter trying to find his way.One scrapbook featured a 1952 front page from the newspaper for the Horace Mann School, the prep school he attended in keeping with his mother’s fervent wish. The headline: “Robert Caro Named Editor of the 1952-53 Record.”Others contained clippings from his years as a reporter on Long Island for Newsday, including his first big investigation: a 1963 series that exposed a scam in which older people, particularly former New York City police officers and firefighters, were being duped into buying retirement-home sites in Arizona’s Mojave Desert with no access to water or utilities.“You might want this,” Mr. Caro said.“Yes, we might,” Ms. Bach said with a laugh.“This is the application for the Pulitzer.”“Wow,” Ms. Bach said.“Well, no,” he said. “I didn’t win.”Another scrapbook was dedicated to “The Power Broker,” which was published in 1974 after seven years of research, doubt and financial hardship. Its success made Mr. Caro.Here were the early print ads for the book; the many profiles of its author; a note from the distinguished journalist Murray Kempton (“…will be seen as a revolutionary challenge to the scholarship that has until now deluded Americans about the way their lives are run.”).Then Mr. Caro fell silent. He had come upon a news clipping he hadn’t seen in more than 50 years: an article he had written for Newsday in 1964 called “Anatomy of a $9 Burglary.”“I thought for a long time this was the best thing I ever wrote,” he said softly.The story details the many lives affected by one small criminal moment: a man burglarizes a Long Island home, steals $9 from a wallet and is quickly caught.Mr. Caro tracked down the still-traumatized victim and her daughter, seven of the 12 jurors in the trial and the defense attorney, who ruefully admitted to being fooled by his client’s professions of innocence. Most affectingly, the young reporter gained the confidence of the burglar’s wife, who initially did not want to talk.She finally opened up about falling in love, realizing that her husband was a criminal, living on welfare while he was imprisoned, trying to protect her two young, heartbroken daughters — and finally deciding to cut ties with their father.The story, on yellowing newsprint kept now in a binder, may be as forgotten as the crime that prompted it. But like the crime, it is also larger than itself, revealing the journalistic meticulousness — the determination to dig deep beneath a moment’s surface — that would become Mr. Caro’s hallmark.“I remember walking away from her house …” he said, then stopped himself. He seemed to struggle with his composure. “I don’t want to say this.”Mr. Caro has done thousands of interviews since, many with people of historical consequence. Still, memories of this long-ago interview, with the wounded but resilient wife of a Long Island criminal, had caught his breath.After a moment, he recalled crying when he wrote this story. Then, with a veteran curator peering over his shoulder, the celebrated author turned the page.</body>
